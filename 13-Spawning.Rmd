# Spawning Behavior

## Overview

This submodel simulates the conditions, triggers, and behavioral outcomes associated with spawning in anadromous fish. It integrates physiological thresholds, habitat preferences, reproductive strategies, and energy-based constraints to identify spawning events and their consequences during migration.

## Purpose and Patterns

This submodel captures ecologically grounded reproductive strategies in anadromous fishes by simulating individual-based spawning behavior as a function of habitat, physiological readiness, and reproductive strategy.

-   Spawning is initiated when agents meet combined salinity and thermal stress thresholds and have sufficient energy reserves, reflecting empirically observed constraints on reproductive viability in migratory fishes.

-   Broadcast spawners initiate spawning in freshwater patches with suitable depth and flow conditions, consistent with the behavior of species like alewife and rainbow smelt. Fertilization success is probabilistically scaled by the local density of mature males, reflecting external gamete mixing dynamics in flowing water.

-   Pairwise spawners, such as sturgeon and striped bass, require physical co-location of a reproductively ready male and female in suitable habitat. This reflects species that engage in close-contact courtship and synchronize gamete release based on microhabitat cues.

-   Spawning events result in an immediate energy cost and update internal states for both male and female agents. Iteroparous species may spawn more than once if conditions remain favorable, while semelparous species are subject to mortality following reproductive exhaustion.

-   Energetic depletion after spawning triggers resting or staging behavior before resuming seaward migration. Overwintering probability is dynamically calculated based on energy levels, spawning timing, age, and size, reflecting seasonal decisions observed in species like Atlantic salmon and shortnose sturgeon.

-   Spatial overlap of spawning-ready agents in high-quality patches allows emergent identification of reproductive hotspots and helps model the intersection of life history traits and estuarine hydrodynamics.

## Process Overview and Scheduling

1.  **Spawning Readiness**\
    Each agent evaluates whether it is spawning-ready based on salinity stress, thermal stress, energy levels, and whether it has exceeded its spawning limit. If all conditions are met, the agent is considered ready to spawn.

2.  **Spawning Strategy**\
    For broadcast spawners, the female initiates spawning if the patch meets the suitability criteria. Fertilization probability is calculated based on the number of males within the local radius. For pairwise spawners, spawning occurs only if one male and one female are both in the same patch, both are spawning-ready, and habitat conditions meet the required criteria.

3.  **Spawning Energy**\
    After spawning, the agent’s energy is reduced by the spawning energy cost.

4.  **Post-Spawning Behavior**\
    If the agent’s energy is sufficient, it switches to seaward migration. If energy is below the threshold, the agent enters a resting/staging state until its energy is restored.

5.  **Mortality Risk**\
    For semelparous species, the mortality risk increases after spawning, with the probability increasing based on age. For iteroparous species, the mortality risk is lower and also age-dependent.

6.  **Overwintering Probability**\
    The overwintering probability is calculated based on the agent's energy, age, size, and days since the last spawning. Overwintering is more likely for older fish, those with low energy, or those that spawned recently.

## Design Concepts

**Basic Principles:** Spawning is constrained by environment (depth, velocity), stress levels, and individual energy.

**Emergence:** High-quality patches with overlapping spawning agents emerge as reproductive hotspots.

**Adaptation:** Iteroparous fish can spawn more than once per season. Fish seek optimal spawning patches when available.

**Objectives:** Maximize reproductive success while maintaining survival energy.

**Learning:** No learning assumed; spawning is rule-based.

**Prediction:** Broadcast spawners indirectly estimate success based on nearby males.

**Sensing:** Agents evaluate temperature, salinity, depth, velocity, and conspecifics in patch or neighborhood.

**Interaction:** Spawning involves male–female pair or proximity-based fertilization.

**Stochasticity:** Spawning success and mortality may include probabilistic outcomes.

**Collectives:** Patch-level broadcast success scales with group density.

**Observation:** Track spawning encounters, spatial events, energy change, mortality, overwintering probability.

## Submodels

### Spawning Readiness

Agents are considered spawning-ready if they meet the following conditions:

$$
\text{SpawningReady} = \begin{cases}\text{true}, & \text{if } S_{stress} < 3 \text{ and } T_{stress} < 3 \text{ and } E_{agent} > E_{spawn} \text{ and } spawn_{n} < lim_{spawn}  \\\text{false}, & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

-   $S_{stress}$ = salinity stress
-   $T_{stress}$ = thermal stress
-   $E_{agent}$ = current energy level of agent
-   $E_{spawn}$ = minimum energy required for spawning (species-specific)
-   $spawn_{n}$ how many spawns agent has performed

### **Spawning Strategy**

##### If `spawning-strategy = broadcast`:

-   Female agent initiates spawning if the patch meets habitat criteria.
-   The agent evaluates **neighboring patches** for the **fertilization probability** ($P_{fertilize}$) sexually mature males in the local radius ($n_{males}$)​.

The fertilization probability is calculated as:

$$
P_{fertilize} = 1 - e^{- \alpha \cdot n_{males}}
$$

Where:

-   $P_{fertilize}$ fertilization success probability

-   $\alpha$ = proximity sensitivity constant

-   $n_{males}$ = number of sexually mature males within a defined radius

If no suitable patch with $P_{fertilize} > 0.5$ is found, the female moves to the next patch and repeats the evaluation process until a suitable patch is identified.

Alternatively, if the female encounters a male in the same patch, the fertilization probability is considered high (near 1), and the female spawns immediately without evaluating neighboring patches.

Spawning encounters are recorded as:

$$
spawn_{n} = spawn_{n} + 1
$$

$$
Spawn_{encounters} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_f} P_{fertilize,i}
$$

Where:

-   $spawn_{encounters}$ is the number of spawning encounters

-   $P_{fertilize}$ is the probability of fertilization.

-   $N_{f}$ is the number of spawning-ready females in suitable patches.

##### If `spawning-strategy = pairwise`:

-   Let $N_{\text{males}}$ be the number of spawning-ready males in the patch.

-   Let $N_{\text{females}}$ be the number of spawning-ready femalesin the patch.

Then, the total number of spawning events in the patch is:

$$
Spawn_{encounters} = \min(N_{\text{males}}, N_{\text{females}})
$$

$$
spawn_{n} = spawn_{encounters}
$$

-   $spawn_{encounters}$ is the number of spawning encounters

-   $spawn_{n}$ is the number of times an agent has spawned

Spawning only occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

1.  One male and one female are in the same patch

2.  Both are `spawning-ready`

3.  Patch-level habitat conditions meet criteria:

$$
d_{patch} \in [d_{min}, d_{max}]
$$

$$
V_{patch} \in [V_{min}, V_{max}]
$$

Where:

-   $d_{patch}$ = patch depth

-   $V_{patch}$ = patch velocity

-   $[d_{min}, d_{max}]$ = species- or stage-specific depth range

-   $[V_{min}, V_{max}]$ = individual- or species-specific velocity preference

### Spawning energy

$$
E_{agent} = E_{agent}-E_{spawn}
$$

Where:

-   $E_{agent}$

-   $E_{spawn}$

### Post-Spawning Behavior

$$
\text{if } E_{\text{agent}} \geq E_{\text{recover}}, \quad \text{then } \texttt{landward_migration?} = \texttt{false}, \quad \texttt{seaward_migration?} = \texttt{true}, \quad \texttt{spawned-this-tick?} = \texttt{true}
$$

Where:

-   $E_{agent}$

-   $E_{recover}$

#### **Mortality Risk**

$$
\text{if } \text{random}(0,1) < P_{\text{mortality}}, \quad \text{then die}$$

$$
P_{\text{mortality}} = \begin{cases}0.9 + 0.1 \cdot \frac{A_{\text{agent}}}{A_{\text{max}}}, & \text{if semelparous} \\0.01 + 0.05 \cdot \frac{A_{\text{agent}}}{A_{\text{max}}}, & \text{if iteroparous}\end{cases}
$$

Where:

-   $A_{\text{agent}}$ = agent’s current age

-   $A_{\text{max}}$ = maximum lifespan for the species

`semelparous` = species that spawn once and die

`iteroparous` = species that can spawn multiple times

#### **Resting Period**

Agents with low energy enter a temporary staging state until recover:

$$
\text{if } E_{\text{agent}} < E_{\text{recover}}, \quad \texttt{staging?} = \texttt{true}$$

Where:

-   $E_{recover}$ energy threshold to resume migration (e.g., 75)

-   $E_{agent}$ is the current energy level of the agents

#### Overwintering Probability

$$
P_{\text{overwinter}} = S_{\text{overwinter}} \cdot \left[  \alpha \cdot \left(1 - \frac{E_{\text{agent}}}{100} \right) +  \beta \cdot \left( \frac{A_{\text{agent}}}{A_{\text{max}}} \right) +  \gamma \cdot \left( \frac{M_{\text{agent}}}{M_{\text{max}}} \right) +  \delta \cdot \left( \frac{t_{\text{spawn}}}{t_{\text{max}}} \right)\right]
$$

Where:

-   $P_{\text{overwinter}}$ = agent’s probability of overwintering
-   $S_{\text{overwinter}}$ = species-level binary (1 = overwinter-capable, 0 = not)
-   $E_{\text{agent}}$ = energy level (0–100%)
-   $A_{\text{agent}}$ = agent age
-   $A_{\text{max}}$ = species-specific maximum age
-   $M_{\text{agent}}$ = agent body size
-   $M_{\text{max}}$ = maximum body size in population
-   $t_{\text{spawn}}$ = days since last spawn
-   $t_{\text{max}}$ = max time allowed for overwinter decision (e.g., 60 days)
-   $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ = tunable weights (e.g., 0.25 each)

**Interpretation**:

-   Lower energy → more likely to overwinter

-   Older or larger fish → more likely to overwinter

-   Fish that spawned recently → higher likelihood (if within seasonal window)

-   Species must be capable of overwintering for this to activate
