# Spawning Behavior

## Overview

This submodel simulates the conditions, triggers, and behavioral outcomes associated with spawning in anadromous fish. It integrates physiological thresholds, habitat preferences, reproductive strategies, and energy-based constraints to identify spawning events and their consequences during migration.

## Purpose and Patterns

This purpose of this submodel is to capture ecologically grounded reproductive strategies by simulating individual-based spawning behavior in relation to environmental variables (salinity, thermal stress, depth, etc.) and physiological conditions (energy levels, reproductive readiness).

-    Spawning initiation is triggered by physiological thresholds:

    -    Salinity and thermal stress are used to simulate habitat suitability, consistent with the needs of anadromous fish like alewife and rainbow smelt.

    -    Agents must have sufficient energy reserves to spawn, ensuring reproductive viability in line with real-world observations of migratory fish constraints.

-    **Broadcast spawners** (e.g., alewife, rainbow smelt) spawn in freshwater patches with appropriate depth and flow conditions. Fertilization success is influenced by male density within the local area, simulating natural gamete mixing.

-    **Pairwise spawners** (e.g., sturgeon, striped bass) require the physical co-location of males and females within a suitable patch for spawning to occur. This reflects close-contact courtship and synchronized gamete release in the wild.

-    **Energy Cost**: Both male and female agents experience an immediate energy cost after spawning. Iteroparous species can spawn multiple times if conditions remain favorable, while semelparous species die after spawning.

-    **Post-Spawning**: Once spawning energy is depleted, agents enter a resting/staging behavior phase until they recover energy and resume migration, especially seaward migration.

-    **Overwintering**: Overwintering probability is modeled dynamically based on agents' energy reserves, size, age, and spawning timing, closely reflecting the seasonal strategies seen in species like Atlantic salmon and shortnose sturgeon.

-    **Reproductive Hotspots**: Spatial overlap of spawning-ready agents in high-quality patches helps identify reproductive hotspots where high-quality habitat intersects with the life-history traits of species and estuarine hydrodynamics.

## Process Overview and Scheduling

1.  **Spawning Readiness**\
    Each agent evaluates whether it is spawning-ready based on salinity stress, thermal stress, energy levels, and whether it has exceeded its spawning limit. If all conditions are met, the agent is considered ready to spawn.

2.  **Spawning Strategy**\
    For broadcast spawners, the female initiates spawning if the patch meets the criteria. Fertilization is based on the number of males able to fertilize the spawning patch. For pairwise spawners, spawning occurs only if one male and one female are both in the same patch, both are spawning-ready, and habitat conditions meet the required criteria.

3.  **Spawning Energy**\
    After spawning, the agent’s energy is reduced by the spawning energy cost.

4.  **Post-Spawning Behavior**\
    If the agent’s energy is sufficient, it switches to seaward migration. If energy is below the threshold, the agent enters a resting/staging state until its energy is restored.

5.  **Mortality Risk**\
    For semelparous species, the mortality risk increases after spawning, with the probability increasing based on age. For iteroparous species, the mortality risk is lower and also age-dependent.

6.  **Overwintering Probability**\
    The overwintering probability is calculated based on the agent's energy, age, size, and days since the last spawning. Overwintering is more likely for older fish, those with low energy, or those that spawned recently.

## Design Concepts

**Basic Principles:** Spawning behavior is indeed influenced by environmental conditions and physiological readiness, which agents evaluate before spawning, as described in the Spawning Readiness and Spawning Strategy submodels.

**Emergence:** High-quality spawning patches emerge when favorable conditions for spawning are present, and the spatial overlap of spawning-ready agents leads to emergent patterns of reproductive success.

**Adaptation:** Fish respond to varying environmental conditions by adjusting their spawning behavior. Iteroparous species may spawn multiple times in a season if conditions remain favorable, whereas semelparous species spawn once and die.

**Objectives:** The primary objective of spawning behavior is to maximize reproductive success by ensuring optimal conditions for fertilization while minimizing the energetic costs.

**Prediction:** Broadcast spawners react to local conditions and male density rather than predicting future conditions, whereas pairwise spawners predict success based on habitat conditions and mate availability.

**Sensing:** Agents sense local environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, depth, velocity) and assess the presence of other agents to determine spawning readiness.

**Interaction:** Male and female agents interact through proximity in pairwise spawning, while broadcast spawners interact with males via fertilization probability calculations. Both strategies involve the exchange of gametes, with varying degrees of synchronization and spatial organization.

**Stochasticity:** The model includes probabilistic factors in mortality.

**Observation:** The model tracks spawning encounters, spawning energy expenditures, energy recovery, mortality rates, and overwintering probabilities.

## Submodels

### Spawning Readiness

Agents are considered spawning-ready if they meet the following physiological conditions:

$$
\text{SpawningReady} = \begin{cases}\text{true}, & \text{if } S_{stress} < 3 \text{ and } T_{stress} < 3 \text{ and } E_{agent} > E_{spawn} \text{ and } spawn_{n} < lim_{spawn} \text{ and } STST? = false \\\text{false}, & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

-   $S_{stress}$ = salinity stress
-   $T_{stress}$ = thermal stress
-   $E_{agent}$ = current energy level of agent
-   $E_{spawn}$ = minimum energy required for spawning (species-specific)
-   $spawn_{n}$ how many spawns agent has performed

### **Spawning Strategy**

##### If `spawning-strategy = broadcast`:

1.  When female agent is ready to spawn, they evaluate neighboring patches:
    -   $S_{\text{patch}} \leq 0.5$
    -   $d_{\text{patch}} \leq d_{\text{spawn}}$

If no suitable patch is found, the female moves to the next patch and repeats the evaluation process until a suitable patch is identified.

Alternatively, if the female encounters a male in the same patch, the fertilization probability is considered high (near 1), and the female spawns immediately without evaluating neighboring patches.

2.  Spawning-ready males actively search for the closest spawning area, where a female has released her eggs. This search is based on both visual cues (proximity) and pheromone-based cues (chemical signals from the female). Ferilization only occurs if a male can find and fertilize the spawn within $t_{limit}$.

Spawning encounters are recorded as:

$$
spawn_{n} = spawn_{n} + 1
$$

$$
Spawn_{encounters} = \sum n_{males}
$$

Where:

-   $spawn_{encounters}$ is the number of spawning encounters

-   $n_{males}$ is the number of males fertilizing the spawn.

-   $N_{f}$ is the number of spawning-ready females in suitable patches.

##### If `spawning-strategy = pairwise`:

1.   Once a female is spawning-ready, she locates the best spawning habitat:

    -   $S_{\text{patch}} \leq 0.5$
    -   $d_{\text{patch}} \leq d_{\text{spawn}}$

2.  Spawning-ready males actively search for the closest spawning-ready female. This search is based on both visual cues (proximity) and pheromone-based cues (chemical signals from the female). Spawning only occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

    -   One male and one female are in the same patch

    -   Both are `spawning-ready`

Then, the total number of spawning events in the patch is:

$$ Spawn_{encounters} = \min(N_{\text{males}}, N_{\text{females}}) $$

$$ spawn_{n} = spawn_{encounters} $$

-   $spawn_{encounters}$ is the number of spawning encounters.

-   $spawn_{n}$ is the number of times an agent has spawned.

-   $N_{\text{males}}$ be the number of spawning-ready males in the patch.

-    $N_{\text{females}}$ be the number of spawning-ready females in the patch.

### Spawning energy

$$
E_{agent} = E_{agent}-E_{spawn}
$$

Where:

-   $E_{agent}$ is the energy levels of the agent.

-   $E_{spawn}$ is the energy cost to spawn.

### Post-Spawning Behavior

$$
\text{if } E_{\text{agent}} \geq E_{\text{recover}}, \quad \text{then } \texttt{landward_migration?} = \texttt{false}, \quad \texttt{seaward_migration?} = \texttt{true}, \quad \texttt{spawned-this-tick?} = \texttt{true}
$$

Where:

-   $E_{agent}$ is the energy levels of the agent.

-   $E_{recover}$ energy threshold to resume migration.

#### **Mortality Risk**

$$
\text{if } \text{random}(0,1) < P_{\text{mortality}}, \quad \text{then die}
$$

$$
P_{\text{mortality}} = \begin{cases}0.9 + 0.1 \cdot \frac{A_{\text{agent}}}{A_{\text{max}}}, & \text{if semelparous} \\0.01 + 0.05 \cdot \frac{A_{\text{agent}}}{A_{\text{max}}}, & \text{if iteroparous}\end{cases}
$$

Where:

-   $A_{\text{agent}}$ is the agent’s current age.

-   $A_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum lifespan for the species.

`semelparous` are species that spawn once and die.

`iteroparous` are species that can spawn multiple times.

#### **Resting Period**

Agents with low energy enter a temporary staging state until recover:

$$
\text{if } E_{\text{agent}} < E_{\text{recover}}, \quad \texttt{staging?} = \texttt{true}
$$

Where:

-   $E_{recover}$ energy threshold to resume migration (e.g., 75).

-   $E_{agent}$ is the current energy level of the agents.

#### Overwintering Probability

$$
P_{\text{overwinter}} = S_{\text{overwinter}} \cdot \left[  \alpha \cdot \left(1 - \frac{E_{\text{agent}}}{100} \right) +  \beta \cdot \left( \frac{A_{\text{agent}}}{A_{\text{max}}} \right) +  \gamma \cdot \left( \frac{M_{\text{agent}}}{M_{\text{max}}} \right) +  \delta \cdot \left( \frac{t_{\text{spawn}}}{t_{\text{max}}} \right)\right]
$$

Where:

-   $P_{\text{overwinter}}$ is the agent’s probability of overwintering.
-   $S_{\text{overwinter}}$ is the species-level binary (1 = overwinter-capable, 0 = not).
-   $E_{\text{agent}}$ is the agent's energy level (0–100%)..
-   $A_{\text{agent}}$ is the agent age.
-   $A_{\text{max}}$ is the species-specific maximum age.
-   $M_{\text{agent}}$ is the agent body size.
-   $M_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum body size in population.
-   $t_{\text{spawn}}$ are the days since last spawn.
-   $t_{\text{max}}$ is the max time allowed for overwinter decision (e.g., 60 days).
-   $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ is the tune-able weights (e.g., 0.25 each).

**Interpretation**:

-   Lower energy → more likely to overwinter

-   Older or larger fish → more likely to overwinter

-   Fish that spawned recently → higher likelihood (if within seasonal window)

-   Species must be capable of overwintering for this to activate
