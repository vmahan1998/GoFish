It is designed to support the standardization and implementation of ABMs in fisheries management, enabling researchers and practitioners to address complex environmental questions and evaluate remediation or restoration scenarios. Motivation The goal of this resource is to support students, researchers, and decision-makers by making agent-based modeling of migratory fish more accessible, reproducible, and applicable to real-world fisheries and habitat management challenges. By providing a standardized modular framework for key behavioral processes, this library promotes consistency, transparency, and credibility in ecological forecasting and decision support tools. It also establishes a foundation for critical conversations about the behaviors and functions represented in modeling, while supporting the empirical quantification of ecological relationships that influence movement, survival, and habitat use of migratory fish. Application Context This library was originally developed in support of research on the influence of tidal behavior and contaminant exposure on anadromous fish in the Penobscot River Estuary. However, its modular design allows for application to other estuarine and coastal systems where fish respond to environmental changes (i.e., salinity, velocity, and pollutants). How to Use This Library Each function or behavior in this library can be combined with others to build a complete agent-based model for anadromous fish. These functions are designed to be adaptable, and easily configured for different species, life stages, or site-specific conditions.

"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Structure", " Chapter 1 Introduction Anadromous fish species such as river herring, striped bass, salmon, and sturgeon navigate coastal and estuarine systems that are increasingly affected by human activity, climate change, and legacy contaminants. Modeling their movement and behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales requires tools that can integrate physiological stressors, environmental variability, and behavior-based decision-making. Agent-based models are among the most powerful tools available for ecological forecasting and fisheries management, but they are also among the most complex. Their structure and computational demands can make them difficult to apply in practical management settings. Many biologists and ecologists who hold deep, species-specific expertise often have limited training in advanced programming or systems modeling. As a result, traditional approaches to simulating anadromous fish frequently oversimplify or exclude key biological functions and environmental interactions such as salinity exposure and contaminant exposure. Existing models also lack standardized representations of these behaviors and interactions, limiting the applicability of results and reducing their usefulness for applied management. This function library was developed to address these limitations by offering modular, empirically grounded components designed for use in modeling migratory fish. Each function is clearly documented and can be applied independently, allowing for transparent testing, modification, and reuse across a wide range of ecological scenarios and sites. 1.1 Structure Each chapter in this library corresponds to a major behavior, physiological function, or foundational component relevant to migratory fish, beginning with: Co-Development of Agent-Based Models Calculate Metabolism Salinity Exposure Temperature Exposure Contaminant Exposure Digestion Filter Feeding Lipid Catabolism Landward Migration Seaward Migration Schooling Selective Tidal Stream Transport Predator-prey interactions The final chapters provide guidance on how to integrate multiple functions into a complete agent-based model, demonstrating how these components work together to simulate fish behavior in dynamic coastal and estuarine systems. Within each chapter, each function or behavior is documented using the ODD protocol (Grimm et al. 2005, 2010, 2020). The ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol is a standardized framework for describing agent-based models. It promotes transparency in model development and ensures consistency across implementations, especially when integrating multiple behavioral or ecological functions. Overview provides the purpose of the model component, identifies the entities involved (e.g., fish agents, environmental patches), and outlines the general processes. Design concepts describe the key theoretical underpinnings such as emergence, adaptation, objectives, sensing, stochasticity, and interaction. Details specify initialization steps, input data requirements, and the rules or submodels that govern behavior. By following the ODD protocol, this library ensures that each function is self-contained, interpretable, and ready for adaptation to a wide range of species, sites, or management scenarios.

"],["agent-based-models.html", "Chapter 2 Agent-Based Models", " Chapter 2 Agent-Based Models Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate the behavior of individual organisms—called “agents”—and how their interactions with each other and with their environment create larger-scale patterns. Each agent follows a set of simple rules based on physiology, behavior, or environmental cues. When many agents follow these rules simultaneously, complex system-level outcomes emerge, such as migration pathways, schooling patterns, habitat bottlenecks, or exposure hotspots. ABMs are especially useful for ecological systems because they allow researchers and communities to explore how individual decisions scale up to influence population dynamics, habitat use, and risk in changing environments. ABMs are designed to capture processes that depend on behavior, timing, environmental variability, and individual differences. They allow modelers to explore how organisms respond to their surroundings, make movement decisions, and interact with other individuals or species. Because agents experience the environment at fine spatial and temporal scales, ABMs can reveal patterns that occur only when many individuals interact across a dynamic landscape. 2.0.1 What ABMs Can Help Us Understand ABMs can answer questions related to: How individual movement decisions accumulate into migration routes or staging locations When and where organisms are most exposed to environmental risks How behaviors such as foraging, schooling, predator avoidance, resting, or spawning influence exposure or survival How variation in traits (size, energy, age, or species) contributes to different outcomes How environmental conditions shape habitat use, movement choices, or interactions between species How system-level patterns emerge from local behaviors and simple rules How alternative conditions or restoration actions might alter movement, habitat use, or exposure These models are especially useful when management questions depend on patterns created by individual behavior, rather than population totals alone. 2.0.2 What ABMs Are Not Designed to Do ABMs cannot provide or replace: Exact estimates of population abundance Precise contaminant concentrations inside individual organisms Direct measurements of chemical or physiological processes Predictions of exact numbers of predation or spawning events Large-scale demographic projections without additional modeling components Replacements for field sampling, monitoring programs, or laboratory measurements Instead, ABMs offer process-based insight, showing how behavior and environmental conditions interact to create observable patterns. 2.0.3 Emergent Behaviors Emergent behavior refers to patterns that arise when many individual agents follow their own rules, creating outcomes that cannot be predicted from observing a single fish on its own. These outcomes develop only when many individuals interact with each other and respond to their surrounding environment at the same time. Many ecological processes such as migration timing, habitat bottlenecks, exposure hotspots, schooling dynamics, predator and prey encounters, and shifts in group structure are emergent rather than linear. They form through small, individual decisions that accumulate into larger and sometimes unexpected system-level patterns. By visualizing and simulating emergence, ABMs make it possible to see how these individual behaviors scale up to influence population level outcomes and habitat use patterns. This helps identify the specific conditions, behaviors, and locations that shape system-wide responses. For management, this is valuable because it shows how small-scale decisions made by individual fish can contribute to broader patterns that influence risk, habitat quality, restoration effectiveness, management actions, and ecological resilience. Understanding emergence allows managers and communities to explore why certain patterns occur, identify potential leverage points, and anticipate how changes in environmental conditions may alter system behavior in the future.

The purpose of this page is to showcase the value added by co-development and increase transparency about the development of this coding library. The Penobscot Estuary Community Modeling Workshop was designed from the beginning as a co-development space for an agent based model to address mercury toxicity dynamics of anadromous fish within the estuary. The day invited Tribal collaborators, community members, managers, and researchers to shape the modeling objectives, including which species, processes, behaviors, and outputs the model should represent, and how those outputs should be represented in relation to contaminant exposure in the Penobscot River Estuary. 3.1 Core Co-Development Themes Several themes guided the design of the workshop and the way it connects to model development. Shared problem framing. The workshop centered a shared concern about mercury contamination in the Penobscot River and its effects on sea-run fish, subsistence access, and recreation use, rather than starting from a predefined modeling objective. Attention to both internal and external processes. Breakout discussions were split into two rounds, one for “internal” or biological functions of fish such as osmoregulation, thermoregulation, bioaccumulation, and resting, and the second round focused on “external processes” or external interactions with intra- or interspecific factors and environmental responses such as swimming, predation, foraging, and spawning. This structure maps directly onto modules detailed within this library. Participant driven priorities. Participants were asked which species were most important to understand for management of the system or species that should be prioritized based on community interest, which functions and interactions they believed to be relevant for understanding mercury toxicity in migratory fish, and how those behaviors should be represented. Outputs that answer real questions. Each participant had the opportunity to propose a question or hypothesis to test using the developed functions and select preferred outputs from the functions such as migration paths, exposure metrics, or habitat use. These wish-list requests now correspond to specific model output routines and visualizations. Accessible language and shared vocabulary. A glossary of terms translated physiological, hydrodynamic, and modeling concepts into accessible language. This glossary can be found at the end of this document and is intended to support a range of readers. Iterative relationships, not a single event. The workshop was framed as one step in an ongoing partnership. Feedback forms, follow-up contact options, and explicit invitations for later review are built into the process. 3.2 Workshop Development 3.2.1 Pre-Workshop Collaboration Steps Planning the workshop involved months of coordination with partners, including the Penobscot Nation, faculty and staff at the University of Maine, and federal collaborators. The planning process itself was a first stage of co-development. Key steps included: Clarifying objectives with partners. Early conversations identified contamination in the Penobscot River, migratory fish, and access to safe subsistence resources as the shared focus. Partners helped guide agenda development, identify potential participants of interest, and identify community outputs of interest to support Tribal management. Their suggestions were used when conducting outreach. Aligning model scope with community priorities. The agenda was constructed so that introductory talks on Penobscot Nation natural resource management and contaminants of interest, an overview of estuary dynamics (connection of fish + physical processes + contamination), and an introduction to agent based modeling were followed by interactive surveys and break-out discussions. This allowed participants to identify anadromous species, behaviors, and processes of interest, which then feed directly into the model design. Preparing interactive polls and prompts. A Mentimeter survey was developed to help participants identify priority species, important environmental drivers, and fish behaviors that shape exposure. These questions now map to the list of behaviors and parameters implemented in the model. Question Example Designing materials for many kinds of learners. Each participant received a notepad and workshop folder, which included a plain-language glossary, a participant agenda, a hypothesis and output worksheet, and a feedback form. These materials supported participants who learn best through reading, writing, discussion, or visual exploration. Break-out discussions were accompanied by visual demonstrations of function demos, allowing participants to directly address draft model functions for each behavior. Find examples below. Note: these are presentations of functions before participant feedback. Updated functions in this library reflect changes informed by the workshop. .grid-container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr)); grid-gap: 20px; margin-top: 1.5em; } .grid-item { padding: 18px; border: 1px solid #d7d7d7; border-radius: 12px; background: #fcfcfc; text-align: center; transition: transform 0.15s ease, box-shadow 0.15s ease; } .grid-item:hover { transform: translateY(-4px); box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.12); } .grid-icon { font-size: 45px; margin-bottom: 10px; } .grid-item h4 { margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.4em; font-size: 1.15em; } .grid-item a { display: block; margin: 4px 0; font-size: 0.95em; text-decoration: none; color: #2a4e8a; } .grid-item a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }  Osmoregulation Demo Info Sheet Output Table ️ Thermoregulation Demo Info Sheet Output Table ☣️ Bioaccumulation Demo Info Sheet Output Table  Resting Demo Info Sheet Output Table ➡️ Migration Demo Info Sheet Output Table ️ Foraging Demo Info Sheet Output Table  Spawning Demo Info Sheet Output Table  Predation Demo Info Sheet Output Table 3.2.2 Identifying Participants of Interest Participant selection was guided by the goal of gathering diverse knowledge about the river and its fish. Tribal Collaborators. Representatives from the Penobscot Nation were invited to collaborate because the Penobscot River Estuary is the Ancestral Homeland of the Penobscot Nation and other Wabanaki Peoples. It was necessary to prioritize their concerns and support their management. We wanted to give them a platform to share their work and management perspectives on migratory fish and contamination. Indigenous people have sovereign rights to migratory species, which have been deeply impacted by contamination in the estuary. Community Experts. The workshop brought in local managers, fishermen, researchers, engineers, and students whose work focuses on estuarine dynamics, fisheries, remediation, and environmental management in the Penobscot, or who focus on anadromous fish. 3.2.3 Enticing Participants to Attend The invitations and overview materials emphasized that this was a hands-on, collaborative event where participant input would shape real model structure and outputs—not a passive lecture. Copy of Invitation Strategies included: Clear framing. The overview highlighted how tidal dynamics, fish behavior, and mercury contamination intersect in the Penobscot River, and described specific opportunities for participants to contribute knowledge during breakout sessions and wish-list activities. The invitation also emphasized that participants did not need any modeling experience—only their expertise and perspectives. Concrete outcomes. Participants could request a specific model output or test a hypothesis relevant to their interests, with results attempted to be shared after the workshop (as feasible within model limitations). Relationship building. The agenda previewed time for partnership discussions, highlighting opportunities to support Tribal priorities and future collaboration on management and research questions. 3.2.4 Selecting the Venue The workshop was held at the Innovation Media Research Center at the University of Maine, a space that could support immersive presentations and movement between small and large group activities. The venue allowed for: A theater-style room with a large screen. The introductory talks and interactive survey used a dark background, low lighting, and a large screen to create an immersive experience similar to an intimate concert hall, while still leaving space for questions and discussion. A separate interactive space. Round tables, easel pads, printed handouts, and discussion areas were set up in a second room for the world-café breakout sessions, allowing participants to interact and face one another in a conversation-style setting as they discussed each function. 3.3 Facilitating the Workshop 3.3.1 Agenda Activities The agenda combined presentations, interactive polls, world-café discussions, and reflection. Key components included: Welcome, blessing, and introductions. The day opened with a welcome and words from the Penobscot Nation, followed by introductions and an icebreaker activity asking participants why they attended and what they hoped to gain. Map-based activities. Participants could pin locations on a system-scale map, connecting their lived experience and knowledge to specific reaches of the river and estuary. This place-based interaction showcased lived knowledge and gave participants autonomy over the spatial representation of the system. Penobscot Nation history and river overview. A management representative of the Penobscot Nation, Dan Kircheis, provided management context for contaminants and migratory fish, grounding the model in current work conducted within the system. Modeling overview and agent based model presentation. Modeling presentations introduced the Penobscot system, key hydrodynamic and contaminant processes, and the rationale for an agent based approach. Examples of emergent behaviors and validation were shown on a large screen to make model dynamics visible and engaging. Mentimeter priority setting. Participants completed an interactive survey about priority species, important environmental drivers, and key behaviors. These responses were summarized live and used to frame the breakout sessions. World café on internal fish processes. Small rotating groups discussed processes such as osmoregulation, thermoregulation, bioaccumulation, and resting. Discussion leaders presented demos and recorded notes, which later informed how these processes are parameterized and sequenced within this library. World café on external behaviors and conditions. A second set of rotations focused on external functions such as foraging, migration, predation, and spawning. These conversations helped identify how fish interact with their environment and where and when the model should track exposure risk. Wish list outputs. Participants wrote down specific outputs they wanted from the model and the reasoning behind each request, including migration timing, exposure patterns, energy budgets, and habitat use. The goal is to incorporate as many of these outputs as possible to support subsequent management and research. Hypothesis Form Model demo. A short demonstration of the model interface supported visual learners and connected the function modules to emergent behaviors. Partnership and next steps discussion. The workshop closed with a short session on building partnerships and identifying community projects where the model could support ongoing work. This included relationship-building between participants and completion of a follow-up survey. Participant Survey Facilitation. Facilitation roles were shared across a team of organizers and volunteers who kept time, prompted discussion, recorded notes, and supported logistics, which allowed the lead modeler to focus on listening and translating insights into model design. 3.4 After the Workshop 3.4.1 Incorporating Feedback Immediately following the workshop, participants were invited to fill out feedback forms on what they found most useful, what felt unclear or missing, and how future workshops or model development activities could be improved. Feedback is being used to: Refine explanations of agent based modeling and estuarine processes in the model interface and supporting documents, using more examples, more visuals, and clearer connections between field observations and model rules. Adjust the balance between presentation time and discussion time. Clarify how participant input has been integrated, so that people can see their contributions in the model structure and outputs rather than only in summary notes. 3.4.2 Post-Workshop Follow-Up Several tools support ongoing co-development after the workshop day itself. This work is still ongoing as products are completed and co-development of final materials continues. Hypothesis and output forms. The participant hypothesis and output form captured individual questions, preferred outputs, and desired scenarios. These forms now guide scenario design and output routines in the model (as much as feasible within model limitations and scope), and follow-up emails will share results with those who opted in. Ongoing communication. Participants who requested follow-up are being contacted with model updates, refinements, and opportunities to review model structure. Follow-up survey. The feedback form includes an option to receive a later survey on model results, which will allow participants to review outputs, comment on whether they find them credible and useful, and suggest further refinements. Tech Transfer Webinar. A planned webinar will support technology transfer of the completed model and products to workshop participants, allowing them to see how their input made it into the final product. Integration into model documentation. This co-development page, the glossary, and workshop-derived figures will be hosted alongside the developed functions to make the participatory process visible to anyone using or reviewing the simulations. 3.4.3 Acknowledgements The workshop and this co developed model were made possible by the time, knowledge, and care shared by workshop participants and organizers. 3.4.3.1 Participants Ernie Atkinson Andrea Casey Devon Gleason Heather Hamlin John Hildebrand Dan Kircheis Dianne Kopec John Kocik Dan Kusnierz Chuck Loring Dan McCaw Amelia McAvoy Sasha Milsky Elias Pinilla Darren Ranco Angie Reed Lauren Ross Justin Stevens Joe Zydlewski 3.4.3.2 Volunteers Nicolas Cyr University of Maine Saba Cyr University of Maine Katherine Daza University of Maine Joseph Dello Russo University of Maine Nalika Lakmali University of Maine Cristian Rojas University of Maine Malavika Sudhakaran University of Maine Kaylyn Zipp University of Maine 3.4.3.3 Organizers: Vanessa Quintana University of Maine; USACE Engineering Research and Development Center Gayle Zydlewski University of Maine; NOAA Sea Grant Katrina Armstrong University of Maine Todd Swannack Texas State University; USACE Engineering Research and Development Center "],["metabolism.html", "Chapter 4 Metabolism 4.1 Overview 4.2 Purpose 4.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 4.4 Process Overview and Scheduling 4.5 Design Concepts 4.6 Initialization 4.7 Submodels 4.8 Netlogo Implementation", " Chapter 4 Metabolism 4.1 Overview Metabolism determines the energy required for fish to maintain basic physiological function, support movement, regulate ions, digest food, and sustain long term migration. This submodel computes metabolic rate based on size, temperature, age scaling, and allometric relationships. Metabolic efficiency, based on divergence from an agent’s optimal temperature, is then scaled toward multiple internal processes including swimming, osmoregulation, and lipid catabolism. 4.2 Purpose To simulate energetically realistic metabolic costs for migratory fishes in coastal and estuarine environments by accounting for size scaling, temperature dependence, age effects, and dynamic energy partitioning across physiological processes. 4.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 4.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5-minute time steps (tick) 4.3.2 Global Variables Global Variable Definition Q10 Temperature coefficient used for metabolic scaling. base-constant Global constant for baseline metabolic scaling (0.1). age-sensitivity Scalar controlling how metabolism changes with age (0.5). 4.3.3 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition temperature The water temperature of the current patch used to calculate temperature dependent metabolic rate. 4.3.4 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition size Body mass or size index used for allometric scaling. age-num Age used in scaling metabolic rate. optimal-temperature Preferred temperature at which baseline metabolism is defined. max-survival-temp Maximum temperature at which the agent can survive and function.

Apply efficiency multipliers to swimming, digestion, osmoregulation, and lipid catabolism. 4.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Metabolic rate combines allometric scaling, temperature responses, and age scaling consistent with metabolic ecology theory. The model uses a Q10 temperature function, Kleiber type allometry, and age dependent reduction in metabolic intensity. Emergence: Energetic constraints emerge from interactions among size, temperature, and age. These constraints then shape movement, digestion, and osmoregulation. Adaptation: Agents adapt by adjusting internal efficiencies that influence downstream behavioral and physiological submodels. Objectives: Agents maintain adequate energy for survival and migration and balance energetic cost across processes. Sensing: Agents sense the temperature of the patch they occupy. Stochasticity: The function itself is deterministic but stochastic variation in individual size and age creates emergent metabolic variation. Collectives: Scaling uses the maximum size and age of the entire population to normalize differences among individuals. Observation: Outputs include metabolism-rate, total-metabolism, and efficiency multipliers. 4.6 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification Met-base Computed using size, age, and temperature factors Establishes a physiologically realistic baseline. swim-base Met-base times movement ratio Allocates baseline metabolism for locomotion.

This submodel simulates the breakdown of ingested prey at a rate proportional to the agent’s current metabolic rate. As stomach contents are digested, a fraction is converted into energy while mercury and methylmercury are incorporated into the agent’s contaminant loads. When stomach contents reach zero, agents transition into foraging mode and begin drawing on lipid reserves. 5.2 Purpose To simulate how migratory fish process ingested prey into energy and contaminants while linking digestive performance to metabolic rate, foraging behavior, and exposure risk.

When stomach contents reach zero, set foraging to true and begin lipid use. 5.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Digestion is modeled as a metabolic rate dependent process, where higher metabolic demand results in greater digestive throughput. Contaminants are transferred into the agent’s body burden proportionally to the fraction of mass digested. Emergence: Patterns of energy gain and contaminant uptake emerge from interactions among foraging success, metabolism, digestion efficiency, and prey availability. Adaptation: Agents respond to depleted stomach contents by transitioning into foraging mode and initiating lipid catabolism when necessary. Objectives: Agents maximize energetic intake to support migration, physiological function, and survival while minimizing energetic deficits. Sensing: Agents sense their own energetic state through stomach contents and energy levels. Stochasticity: Stochasticity arises indirectly from variation in prey encounters or foraging success, although digestion itself is deterministic. Collectives: Digestion occurs independently for each agent and does not require group level dynamics. Observation: Outputs of interest include digested mass per tick, gained energy, contaminant uptake, and cumulative contaminant burdens. 5.6 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification stomach-contents 0 Agents begin without prey unless defined by scenario. stomach-contents-Hg 0 No initial inorganic mercury from digestion. stomach-contents-MeHg 0 No initial methylmercury from digestion. digestion-efficiency Species specific Determines fraction of biomass converted to energy. foraging true Agents begin in search mode when stomach is empty. 5.7 Submodels 5.7.1 Digestion Rate and Breakdown Digestive throughput is driven by metabolic rate: \\[ digestion\\text{-}rate = metabolism\\text{-}rate \\] Digested mass per tick: \\[ digested = stomach\\text{-}contents \\cdot digestion\\text{-}rate \\] Proportional mercury assimilation: \\[ digested\\text{-}Hg = \\left( \\frac{digested}{stomach\\text{-}contents} \\right) \\cdot stomach\\text{-}contents\\text{-}Hg \\] \\[ digested\\text{-}MeHg = \\left( \\frac{digested}{stomach\\text{-}contents} \\right) \\cdot stomach\\text{-}contents\\text{-}MeHg \\] Updated stomach contents: \\[ stomach\\text{-}contents = stomach\\text{-}contents - digested \\] 5.7.2 Energy Conversion Energy gained from digestion: \\[ gained\\text{-}energy = digested \\cdot digestion\\text{-}efficiency \\cdot 40 \\] Updated energy pool: \\[ energy = energy + gained\\text{-}energy \\] 5.7.3 Contaminant Assimilation Contaminants absorbed during digestion: \\[ mehg\\text{-}foraging = digested\\text{-}MeHg \\] \\[ hg\\text{-}foraging = digested\\text{-}Hg \\] Accumulated body burden: \\[ mehg\\text{-}total = mehg\\text{-}total + digested\\text{-}MeHg \\] \\[ hg\\text{-}total = hg\\text{-}total + digested\\text{-}Hg \\] 5.7.4 Transition to Foraging When stomach contents reach zero: lipid-loss is activated This switches the prey to burn fat energy reserves instead of relying on stomach contents. 5.8 Netlogo Implementation ;;

Deduct energy expenditure from agent’s energy pool. 6.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: The model is based on principles of physiological ecology and osmoregulatory energetics in teleost and apterygian species. It draws from empirical findings (e.g., Allen et al., 2009; Little et al., 2023) and includes size scaling, stress buffering, and energy constraints. These principles are implemented at the submodel level (e.g., chloride proliferation, stress calculation) to simulate realistic physiological feedbacks to changes in environmental salinity. Emergence: Ion-regulatory stress, chloride cell expression, and energy expenditure emerge from an agent’s interaction with temporally and spatially variable salinity environments. These patterns are not pre-specified but arise dynamically through adaptive physiological responses. Adaptation: Agents respond to osmotic stress by adjusting chloride cell density, a trait that buffers stress. This process allows individuals to reduce internal-external salinity gradients and maintain ion homeostasis. Objectives: Agents seek to support survival by reducing stress and avoiding excessive energy loss through regulating chloride cell expression. Sensing: Agents sense local salinity (\\(S_{patch}\\)) and compare it with their acclimated salinity (\\(S_{agent}\\)). They also track their own energy state and time since last osmoregulation.

The greater the stress, the higher the target chloride density the agent attempts to reach, up to a maximum threshold. Agents adjust their chloride cell density based on their current ion-regulatory stress and acclimation status. Chloride cells are not adjusted unless the agent’s energy exceeds 25%. The chloride cell density is based on stress: \\[ C_{target} = C_{min} + (C_{max} - C_{min}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{I_{stress}}{10}\\right) \\] If salinity conditions have remained stable for an extended period (e.g., 288 ticks), \\(C_{target}\\) is slightly reduced to reflect partial downregulation of chloride cells due to long-term acclimation: \\[ C_{target} = C_{target} \\cdot 0.99 \\quad \\text{if stable} \\] Chloride cell density then approaches the target using a double-rate adjustment and capped maximum rate of change: \\[ \\Delta C = \\left(C_{target} - C_{current}\\right) \\cdot \\left(2 \\cdot R_{proliferation}\\right) \\] \\[ \\Delta C = \\max\\left(-R_{max}, \\min(R_{max}, \\Delta C)\\right) \\] If the agent has low energy (\\(\\leq 50\\%\\)), the adjustment rate is halved: \\[ \\Delta C = \\Delta C \\cdot 0.5 \\quad \\text{if energy is low} \\] Finally, the chloride cell density is updated and constrained between \\(C_{min}\\) and \\(C_{max}\\): \\[ C_{new} = \\max(C_{min}, \\min(C_{max}, C_{current} + \\Delta C)) \\] This ensures that the agent does not overshoot the physiologically realistic limit of chloride cell density, while still responding to osmotic stress. Chloride density is only recalculated after a given acclimation interval: \\[ t_{osmo} \\geq \\alpha^{-1} \\] After updating, the acclimation timer is reset: \\[ t_{osmo} = 0 \\] This prevents agents from recalculating chloride density every time step and allows for controlled, realistic responses to prolonged stress and salinity changes.

Alewife Migration Probability 7.10 Netlogo Implementation", " Chapter 7 Migration Cues 7.1 Overview This submodel simulates how migratory fish detect environmental cues that signal the onset of migration. The mechanism is grounded in empirical evidence that simultaneous declines in daylength and temperature reliably precede the initiation of seaward migration in several anadromous species. In this model, migration begins only when a fish experiences environmental conditions consistent with an autumnal cue window defined by: A decline in daylength \\[ \\Delta L &lt; 0 \\] A decline in temperature \\[ \\Delta T &lt; 0 \\] And these declines occurring on the same day, indicating a coincident decline When this occurs, the day is labeled a cue day. Upon reaching cue days, individuals begin stochastically accumulating the probability of initiating migration. For predators (striped bass), migration probability additionally depends on alewife presence, linking species interactions to migration onset. 7.2 Purpose The purpose of this submodel is to mechanistically trigger migration using real, observed environmental phenology rather than arbitrary or date-based rules. This framework captures how: Changes in ΔTemperature and ΔDaylength structure seasonality Migration timing emerges pragmatically rather than being fixed Fish respond to external conditions and species interactions Environmental preprocessing in R feeds into NetLogo behavioral rules This allows migration in the model to originate from measurable ecological drivers instead of hard-coded thresholds. 7.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 7.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5-minute time steps (tick) 7.3.2 Global Variables Global Variable Definition cue-table Lookup table containing ΔTemperature, ΔDaylength, their smoothed values, and Boolean coincident-decline flags (from R preprocessing) cue-days List of day-of-year values where ΔT &lt; 0 and ΔL &lt; 0 simultaneously (identified in R) ΔT Daily rate of change in temperature imported from R (dT_per_day_f or smoothed dT_smooth) ΔL Daily rate of change in photoperiod imported from R (dL_per_day_min or smoothed dL_smooth) cue-active?

Normalize patch contaminants between 0 and 1. Compare patch levels to stress thresholds. Update exposure durations. Compute uptake risk using metabolism, ionregulatory stress, and SPM. Add uptake risk to cumulative body burden. Update patch level species specific risk metrics. 8.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Contaminant uptake follows toxicokinetic principles where absorption increases with concentration, metabolic rate, and suspended particulate matter (SPM). Depth averaged SPM reflects hydrodynamic transport and particle bound contaminant processes for fish typically found near the middle of the water column. Emergence: Exposure and risk patterns emerge from individual movement across heterogeneous contamination fields coupled with metabolic and stress driven physiology. Adaptation: Agents do not actively avoid contamination, but their internal physiology modulates uptake in response to metabolic changes. Objectives: This model does not give agents risk minimization behavior. Instead, risk is assessed to evaluate means of exposure pathways and cumulative toxic exposure. Sensing: Agents sense patch level mercury, methylmercury, SPM, and internal metabolic state. Stochasticity: Variation in spatial contaminant fields or individual characteristics and state creates stochastic variation in exposure. Observation: Outputs include instantaneous exposure risk, cumulative exposure risk, normalized exposure totals, and patch level species specific contributions. 8.6 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification mercury Input layer Hydrodynamic or field derived contaminant layer. methylmercury Input layer Same as above.

In this submodel, agents evaluate neighboring patches based on suspended particulate matter concentration and selectively filter feed where energetic return is highest. Filtration capacity increases with body size, metabolic rate, and digestion efficiency, and is reduced under competition from other filter feeding fish. Contaminant loads in the water column directly influence mercury and methylmercury assimilation during feeding, including biomagnification effects. 9.2 Purpose and Patterns The purpose of this submodel is to simulate ecologically realistic filter feeding behavior in migratory fish using suspended particulate matter as a food resource. This behavior links hydrodynamic particle fields to energy gain, contaminant exposure, and movement decisions. Filter feeding only occurs when spatial conditions and energetic returns are favorable, and incorporates competition, biomagnification, and digestion constraints. This submodel represents the following ecological patterns: Filtration capacity increases with body size, metabolism, and digestive efficiency Larger individuals with higher metabolism filter more water and assimilate more prey mass. Gaussian SPM preference centered on optimal SPM Feeding intensity is highest near an optimal SPM range and decreases away from that peak. Crowding penalty from con-specifics Filtration benefit decreases when multiple individuals feed in the same patch. Movement toward highest benefit Fish move toward the patch with the highest filtration benefit based on SPM and competitive pressure. Contaminant assimilation tied directly to filtration Mercury and methylmercury are assimilated proportionally to SPM concentration and biomagnification factors derived from empirical trophic magnification relationships. 9.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 9.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5 minute time steps (tick) 9.3.2 Global Variables Global Variable Definition spm-sd Standard deviation for Gaussian SPM preference curve (controls width of feeding preference) max-filter-distance Maximum distance within which patches can be evaluated (optional, model dependent) BMF-MeHg Biomagnification factor for methylmercury (≈ 1.74; after Lavoie et al. 2013) BMF-Hg Biomagnification factor for inorganic Hg (≈ 1.38; after Lavoie et al. 2013) previous-x X-coordinate of agent’s previous location (used to compute travel distance and energy cost) previous-y Y-coordinate of agent’s previous location (used with previous-x) 9.3.3 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition SPM Suspended particulate matter concentration in the water column mercury Inorganic mercury concentration at the patch methylmercury Methylmercury concentration at the patch patch-terrain Identifies water or land patches 9.3.4 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition size Body size used to scale filtration capacity weight Biomass used in base filtration scaling (from metabolism submodel) metabolism-rate Metabolic rate that modulates filtration intensity digestion-efficiency Fraction of filtered biomass digested optimal-SPM SPM concentration where filtration is most efficient filter-feed?

Evaluate neighboring patches using a Gaussian suitability curve around optimal SPM. Apply a competition penalty based on the number of con-specifics feeding on each patch. Select the patch with the highest filtration benefit. Move toward the chosen patch with travel distance reduced by swimming efficiency. Apply swimming energy cost. Filter feed by assimilating SPM scaled biomass from the chosen patch. Assimilate mercury and methylmercury using biomagnification factors from Lavoie et al (2013). Add assimilated biomass and contaminants to stomach contents. 9.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles Filter feeding reflects how pelagic and estuarine fish forage on suspended particles while migrating. Filtration scales with size, metabolism, and digestive efficiency. SPM determines food availability and contaminant exposure. Emergence Feeding hotspots emerge where hydrodynamic SPM fields align with optimal SPM and competition is minimal. Contaminant loads emerge from local mercury and methylmercury concentrations and biomagnification. Adaptation Agents adjust their direction and feeding behavior based on SPM quality, filtration capacity, and local competition. Sensing Agents sense SPM, mercury, methylmercury, competition from conspecifics, stomach fullness, and their own metabolic and digestive state. Stochasticity Variation in SPM quality, contaminant concentrations, and local competition create variability in feeding and assimilation outcomes. Interaction Competition reduces filtration benefit when more fish feed on the same patch. Mercury and methylmercury assimilation depends on local contaminant levels and feeding intensity.

In this submodel, agents metabolize stored lipid reserves to restore energy, maintain migration, and avoid starvation. Lipid use is influenced by body condition, metabolic efficiency, and the magnitude of energetic deficit. Lipid depletion also reduces body weight over time, creating a biologically meaningful cost to sustained lipid reliance. Contaminant uptake does not occur during lipid catabolism, reflecting the absence of feeding. 9.9 Purpose The purpose of this submodel is to simulate endogenous energy mobilization through lipid reserves when fish cannot meet energetic needs through feeding. Lipid catabolism allows migratory fish to continue movement and survive temporary periods of low food availability. This mechanism reflects empirical observations of lipid use during spawning migrations, overwintering, and other energetically demanding life history periods. This submodel is best used in tandpm with an energy recovery stratedge like filter feelding and digestion, or pref=dation and digesiton 9.10 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 9.10.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5 minute time steps (tick) 9.10.2 Global Variables Global Variable Definition full-energy-level Target energy level used to compute energetic deficit during lipid use (default = 100). energy-per-lipid Energy returned per unit lipid mass mobilized (default = 40), used to convert lipid into energy. lipid-refill-fraction Fraction of body mass available to mobilize as lipid during fasting (default = 0.5). lipid-max-fraction (optional) Upper bound on lipid fraction that can be lost before mortality or physiological collapse (not currently enforced but biologically relevant). debug-lipid?

Determine the lipid amount needed to fill the deficit. Limit lipid use by the maximum lipid available for mobilization. Apply lipid catabolism efficiency to determine usable lipid energy. Convert mobilized lipid to energy. Reduce weight by the amount of lipid burned. Set contaminant uptake to zero during this process, since no feeding occurs. 9.12 Design Concepts Basic Principles Lipid catabolism models endogenous energy mobilization in the absence of food. Fish draw upon lipid stores when energy is low, which is a well documented physiological process during migration, overwintering, and fasting. Emergence Patterns of weight loss, energy cycling, and recovery emerge from repeated lipid use during periods of limited food access. Adaptation Agents adaptively mobilize lipids based on the severity of their energy deficit and on efficiency scaling from the metabolism submodel. Objectives Agents seek to maintain enough energy to migrate, forage, avoid predation, and prevent starvation. Sensing Agents sense their own internal energy level and lipid reserve availability. Interaction Lipid catabolism does not require environmental interaction and therefore represents a purely endogenous process. Stochasticity This submodel is deterministic. However, variation in weight, metabolism, and previous feeding creates emergent differences among individuals. Observation Outputs include energy restored through lipid catabolism, lipid used, and body mass loss over time. 9.13 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification weight species specific Establishes initial body condition original-weight equal to initial weight Defines total lipid availability energy 100 Full energy at initialization lipid-catabolism-efficiency from metabolism submodel Reflects physiological scaling of lipid use lipid-used 0 No lipid used at start 9.14 Submodels 9.14.1 Lipid Mobilization Maximum lipid available for mobilization depends on relative body mass: \\[ Lipid_{refill} = 0.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{weight}{original\\_weight}\\right) \\] Energy deficit relative to full energy: \\[ Energy_{deficit} = 100 - Energy \\] Lipid required to refill the deficit: \\[ Lipid_{needed} = \\frac{Energy_{deficit}}{40} \\] Actual lipid mobilized: \\[ Lipid_{used} = \\min(Lipid_{needed},\\ Lipid_{refill}) \\times lipid\\_{catabolism\\_efficiency} \\] 9.14.2 Energy Conversion Mobilized lipid is converted into energy: \\[ Energy_{added} = Lipid_{used} \\times 40 \\] Energy is capped at one hundred: \\[ Energy = \\min(100,\\ Energy + Energy_{added}) \\] 9.14.3 Weight Loss Weight decreases proportionally to lipid used: \\[ Weight = Weight - Lipid_{used} \\] 9.14.4 Contaminant Bookkeeping No mercury or methylmercury is acquired during lipid catabolism: \\[ MeHg_{digested} = 0 \\] \\[ Hg_{digested} = 0 \\] These values are added to cumulative totals to maintain bookkeeping consistency, but do not increase contaminant burden. 9.15 Netlogo Implementation ;; =================================================================== ;; LIPID CATABOLISM SUBMODEL DECLARATIONS ;; =================================================================== turtles-own [ ;; Energetics &amp; body condition energy weight original-weight ;; Lipid metabolism lipid-catabolism-efficiency lipid-used ;; Metabolic rate inputs metabolism-rate baseline-metabolism-rate ;; Contaminant bookkeeping during fasting mehg-foraging hg-foraging mehg-foraging-total hg-foraging-total mehg-total hg-total ] ;; =================================================================== ;; LIPID CATABOLISM SUBMODEL ;; =================================================================== to lipid-loss ;; Maximum lipid metabolized this step, adjusted by efficiency let lipid-refill 0.5 * (weight / original-weight) ;print (word &quot;lipid-refill: &quot; lipid-refill) ;print (word &quot;current energy: &quot; energy) ;; Calculate deficit and lipid need let energy-deficit (100 - energy) ;print (word &quot;energy-deficit: &quot; energy-deficit) let lipid-needed (energy-deficit / 40) ;print (word &quot;lipid-needed: &quot; lipid-needed) ;; Actual lipid use depends on efficiency and availability let lipid-used (min list lipid-needed lipid-refill) set lipid-used (lipid-used * lipid-catabolism-efficiency) ;print (word &quot;lipid-used: &quot; lipid-used) ;; Convert lipid to energy (scaled by efficiency) let energy-change (lipid-used * 40) ;print (word &quot;energy added: &quot; energy-change) set energy (energy + energy-change) ;print (word &quot;energy after lipid conversion: &quot; energy) if energy &gt; 100 [ set energy 100 print &quot;energy capped at 100&quot; ] ;; Weight loss proportional to lipid burned set weight weight - (lipid-used) ;print (word &quot;weight after lipid loss: &quot; weight) ;; When relying on lipids, Hg mercury foraging risk stops ;; contaminant bookkeeping let digested-MeHg 0 let digested-Hg 0 set mehg-foraging digested-MeHg set hg-foraging digested-Hg set mehg-foraging-total mehg-foraging-total + digested-MeHg set hg-foraging-total hg-foraging-total + digested-Hg set mehg-total mehg-total + digested-MeHg set hg-total hg-total + digested-Hg end References Lavoie, Raphael A., Timothy D.

In this model, schooling increases hydrodynamic efficiency, predator avoidance, and coordinated migration. The submodel follows the classic behavioral rules from agent based schooling and BOIDS frameworks (separation, alignment, and cohesion). The schooling behavior in this model is adapted from the publicly available NetLogo model Fish Schooling For Predator Avoidance created by Sebastian Dobon and shared through the NetLogo Modeling Commons. That model implements classic schooling rules from the original BOIDS framework developed by Craig Reynolds in 1987 in his paper Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model (Reynolds 1987). 12.2 Purpose The purpose of this submodel is to simulate collective movement patterns observed in migratory fish where individuals adjust their position and speed based on nearby schoolmates. This mechanism enhances group cohesion during landward or seaward migration and produces emergent school structure, directional alignment, and spacing. 12.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 12.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5 minute time steps (tick) 12.3.2 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition patch-terrain Identifies water or land patches 12.3.3 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition breed Species identity used to restrict schooling to con-specifics speed Current swimming speed min-speed Lowest allowable swimming speed start-migration?

Detect the nearest neighbor among schoolmates. Apply separation when neighbors are too close. Apply cohesion and alignment when spacing is adequate. Adjust speed to match group speed and maintain coordination. 12.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles Schooling arises from separation, cohesion, and alignment. These rules reflect collective behaviors observed in migrating fishes. Emergence Cohesive schools, spacing patterns, and synchronized direction arise without centralized control. Adaptation Agents adjust heading and speed in response to nearby schoolmates. Objectives Fish do not attempt to form schools explicitly. Schooling emerges from local rules. Learning There is no internal learning. Behavior is reactive and rule based. Prediction Agents do not predict future states of neighbors. They respond to current spacing and direction. Sensing Agents sense species identity, distance to schoolmates, spacing, and local movement direction. Interaction Agents change speed and heading based on interactions with neighbors. Stochasticity Small random turning angles elsewhere in the model introduce variability in movement. Collectives Schools form as dynamic collectives with shared direction and spacing rules. Observation School size, spacing, direction, and cohesion may be tracked to evaluate emergent schooling patterns. 12.6 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification speed species specific Starting swimming speed min-speed species specific Prevents schools from stopping entirely schoolmates empty set No neighbors until movement begins nearest-neighbor none Determined dynamically during the simulation minimum-separation species specific Prevents collisions and maintains spacing 12.7 Submodels 12.7.1 Identifying Schoolmates Fish select schoolmates from nearby con-specifics that share the same migration state, including the start of migration and direction (landward or seaward). 12.7.2 Nearest Neighbor The closest schoolmate is used to determine whether spacing rules or cohesion rules should be applied. 12.7.3 Separation If the nearest neighbor is closer than the minimum desired separation, the agent turns away to maintain spacing. 12.7.4 Cohesion When spacing is appropriate, the agent turns toward the group centroid to maintain cohesive structure. 12.7.5 Alignment The agent aligns its heading with the mean direction of nearby con-specifics to maintain synchronized movement. 12.7.6 Speed Adjustment Speed is regulated to preserve cohesion within the school: The agent accelerates if any schoolmate is significantly faster. Otherwise, it gradually slows toward the minimum speed.

It is triggered when the along-channel velocity of the patch exceeds the agent’s effective swimming speed, and that speed is below a species-specific minimum threshold. Once engaged, agents align with the tidal current and are carried downstream or upstream, depending on flow velocity. STST reduces the metabolic cost of movement by substituting active swimming with passive transport. This behavior persists for a limited duration or until swimming ability improves, after which agents resume directional migration. 13.2 Purpose To simulate a passive energy-conserving behavior in migratory fish that allows them to use tidal currents to move when swimming capacity is insufficient to overcome flow velocities. 13.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 13.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5 minute time steps (tick) 13.3.2 Global Variables Variable Name Definition max-seaward-velocity Highest magnitude seaward-directed hydrodynamic velocity across the spatial domain. max-landward-velocity Highest magnitude landward-directed hydrodynamic velocity across the spatial domain. 13.3.3 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition Velocity \\(V_{patch}\\) The along-channel velocity of a given patch, derived from hydrodynamic model inputs, where positive values are in the landward direction and negative values are in the seaward direction. tidal-transport-in-patch Count of agents exhibiting tidal stream transport within a patch (for habitat quality analysis). 13.3.4 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition energy \\(E_{agent}\\) Total energy available to the agent. swimming energy \\(E_{swim}\\) Energy expenditure from movement per time step. base swim energy \\(swim_{base}\\) Baseline energy cost of movement. swimming difficulty \\(D_f\\) Velocity-based proxy representing hydrodynamic resistance. in-STST? \\(STST_{?}\\) Boolean value indicating if the agent is actively in STST. swimming speed \\(V_{agent}\\) The effective swimming speed of the agent. minimum threshold speed \\(Speed_{min}\\) The minimum speed at which an agent will move. 13.4 Process Overview and Scheduling Compare swimming speed (\\(V_{agent}\\)) with flow speed (\\(V_{patch}\\)).

If \\(V_{agent} &gt; Speed_{min}\\), exit STST and resume active swimming. 13.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Selective tidal stream transport is based on behavioral ecology and energetics, simulating the tradeoff between active swimming and energy conservation through passive transport. Emergence: Passive drift behavior and resulting migration paths emerge from agent-flow interactions and individual swimming limitations. Adaptation: Agents adapt their mode of movement based on their swimming ability relative to environmental flow, dynamically choosing energy-efficient strategies. Objectives: Agents seek to minimizing energy loss in strong flows. Sensing: Agents sense their own \\(V_{agent}\\) and the \\(V_{patch}\\) to determine whether passive drift is needed.

Predators detect, pursue, and consume prey based on visibility conditions and prey size constraints. Prey detect approaching predators through visual and social cues and respond with directional fleeing behaviors, which vary based on their size, age, energy level, and water clarity. These behaviors reflect biologically observed trade-offs between escape speed, reaction time, and group-based vigilance. The model also tracks predator energy gain and prey energy depletion and recovery, allowing for analysis of individual fitness and risk exposure under different environmental and behavioral conditions. 14.2 Purpose and Patterns This submodel captures ecologically grounded predator–prey dynamics by simulating behaviorally realistic rules of pursuit and evasion observed in estuarine fishes. Prey initiate fleeing based on predator proximity, visual detection, and turbidity-adjusted reaction time, reflecting sensory limitations in murky estuarine water. Predators only pursue prey that are within their gape limit and provide a favorable energy return, consistent with optimal foraging theory and size-selective predation. Fleeing speed is scaled by energy and body size, capturing the biologically observed trade-off between fatigue and escape performance. Directional fleeing (left, right, up, or down) is based on the predator’s relative position, aligning with empirical studies on spatial escape responses. Patch-level alarm cues propagate fleeing behavior across prey groups, mimicking the benefits of schooling and collective vigilance in fish. Energetic constraints influence both predator foraging frequency and prey escape success, contributing to variability in encounter outcomes. Spatial tracking of predation events allows identification of high-risk zones, offering insight into how environmental conditions shape survival landscapes. 14.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 14.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5 minute time steps (tick) 14.3.2 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition Suspended-particulate-matter \\(SPM_{t}\\) Level of suspended material in patch (exponential difficulty increase between min and max observed in system) worse vision at max, best vision at min Prey-Eaten-in-Patch Counts how much prey are consumed in a patch Prey-in-Patch \\(prey-in-patch_{t}\\) The amount of prey currently in the patch prey-alarmed?

If so, the prey calculates reaction time based on its own size, age, flee-ability, local SPM, and the predator’s size and speed. Directional Escape If the reaction time threshold is met, the prey executes a directional fleeing behavior (scare-left, scare-right, scare-down, or scare-up), and sets the patch to prey-alarmed? = true. Schooling Response All other prey in the same patch automatically begin fleeing when prey-alarmed? = true, simulating social alarm propagation. Speed and Energy Update If the agent is fleeing, its speed increases toward max-flee, and energy is reduced based on movement cost. If not fleeing, the agent moves normally and may recover energy depending on its resting status. 14.4.2 Predator Behavior (per agent) Visual Detection The predator identifies prey within its in-cone vision, adjusted based on local SPM concentration, prey size, and predator size. Prey Filtering Prey that exceed the predator’s gape limit or whose handling effort exceeds the predator’s available energy are excluded. Prey Selection Among remaining prey, the predator evaluates candidates using an optimal foraging approach that considers size, handling effort, and net energy gain. One prey is selected. Pursuit Decision If a prey is selected, the predator enters a bursting state, increasing its speed toward max-speed. Reaction time is computed based on predator age, size, SPM, and prey proximity. Scare Prey The predator triggers fleeing in visible prey by calling the scare-prey procedure. If any prey flees, the patch is flagged as prey-alarmed? = true. Consume Prey If within striking range, the predator consumes the prey and updates variables: daytime-prey-eaten, prey-species-eaten, total-prey-eaten, and Prey-Eaten-in-Patch. Digestion If no prey are eaten, time-since-eaten increases. If the predator has reached its daily feeding limit, it enters a digestive phase. Digestion ends when both time-since-eaten and time-since-full exceed the digestion time 14.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Simulates predator and prey interactions in a spatial estuarine system. Behaviors such as chasing, fleeing, and feeding are determined by individual traits, patch conditions, and environmental clarity due to suspended particulate matter. Emergence: Predation hotspots develop in areas with higher prey density and better visibility. Prey movement and group alarm responses create shifting patterns of refuge and risk across the landscape. Adaptation: Prey modify their direction and intensity of escape based on the predator’s location and their own size, age, and escape ability. Predators filter out prey that are too large to consume and shift to resting behavior after reaching their feeding limit. Objectives: Predators aim to select prey that provide the highest net energy gain while minimizing pursuit and handling costs. Prey aim to avoid detection or flee successfully using both individual detection and social alarm cues. Learning: Learning is represented through Mid-aged agents generally perform better than very young or very old individuals. Prediction: Sensing: Agents rely on in-radius and in-cone vision to detect others. Detection range is influenced by water clarity, body size, and prey movement. Predators exclude prey that are too large to handle even if they fall within the visible field. Interaction: Predators and prey interact through visual detection, spatial proximity, and energy transfer through feeding. Social interactions occur through alarm cue propagation at the patch level and school level. Stochasticity: Prey selection, fleeing direction, and reaction timing include probabilistic variation. Randomness is used to reflect natural variability in movement and perception. Collectives: When one prey detects a predator and flees, all prey in the same patch respond. This collective behavior improves predator detection and increases the likelihood of survival through schooling. Observation: Key outputs include prey consumption, alarm responses, spatial predation distribution, and energy use of individual agents. 14.6 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification energy 100 Prey begin fully energized to allow immediate fleeing or normal movement fleeing? false Prey are not actively escaping at the start prey-alarmed? false Alarm cue inactive at start of simulation daytime-prey-eaten 0 daily counter of prey eaten starts at zero time-since-full 0 predator begins simulation hungry gape-limit function of size Large predators have wider gape limits handling-effort calculated per encounter Depends on prey traits and local patch conditions reaction-time size-, age-, and SPM-based Prey and predator values dynamically computed each tick flee-ability based on age Represents individual escape competence across age classes predation-ability based on age Mid-age predators have fastest and most accurate prey responses \\(swim_{max}\\) \\(1.5-3 \\frac{body lengths}{sec}\\) Typical value for sustained swimming speed in small pelagic fish (refer to Videler, 1993). 14.7 Submodels 14.7.1 Prey Detection Probability Visual detection of prey by predators is scaled by local water clarity, prey size, and prey movement. The effective detection radius decreases as SPM increases and increases as prey size increases. \\[ P_{detect} = \\left( \\frac{S_{prey}}{S_{max}} \\right) \\cdot e^{-SPM_t / \\tau} \\] Where: \\(P_{detect}\\) is the probability of detecting a prey agent. \\(S_{prey}\\) is the size of the prey agent. \\(S_{max}\\) is the maximum size of any prey in the system. \\(SPM_t\\) is the suspended particulate matter concentration in the current patch. \\(\\tau\\) is a turbidity scaling constant. Biological Justification: Larger prey are more visible, but high turbidity (SPM) reduces contrast and visual range. The exponential function reflects rapid degradation of visibility with increased turbidity. 14.7.2 Reaction Time Reaction time determines how quickly an agent initiates a behavior in response to a threat (for prey) or opportunity (for predators). It is influenced by SPM, size, age, and ability. \\[ RT_{agent} = \\left( \\frac{1}{F_{ability}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{opp}}{S_{agent}} \\right) \\cdot (1 + \\alpha \\cdot SPM_t) \\] Where: \\(RT_{agent}\\) is the reaction time of the prey or predator. \\(F_{ability}\\) is flee-ability (for prey) or predation-ability (for predators). \\(S_{opp}\\) is the size of the opposing agent (predator or prey). \\(S_{agent}\\) is the size of the focal agent. \\(SPM_t\\) is the suspended particulate matter in the patch. \\(\\alpha\\) is the turbidity penalty factor. Biological Justification: Smaller or younger fish tend to react slower. High turbidity delays response time. Age-related ability improves reaction time in middle-aged agents. 14.7.3 Alarm Response Propagation \\[ P_{alarm} = 1 - e^{\\frac{-n_{flex}}{k}} \\] Where: \\(P_{alarm}\\) is the probability that non-detecting prey will flee. \\(n_{flee}\\) is the number of fleeing fish in the patch. \\(\\kappa\\) is a sensitivity constant governing social responsiveness. Biological Justification: Prey benefit from collective vigilance. The more individuals that flee in a patch, the more likely others will follow. 14.7.4 Fleeing Speed The maximum speed a prey agent can reach when fleeing is scaled by body size, energy, and physical acceleration limits. \\[ V_{flee} = V_{max} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{E_{agent}}{100} \\right) + \\delta \\cdot S_{agent} \\] Where: \\(V_{flee}\\) is the maximum fleeing speed. \\(V_{max}\\) is the prey’s maximum speed. \\(E_{agent}\\) is the energy level of the prey agent. \\(S_{agent}\\) is the size of the prey. \\(\\delta\\) is a scaling factor for size-based speed increase. Biological Justification: Larger prey generally swim faster, but energy limits how much of that speed can be used. Exhausted fish flee more slowly. 14.7.5 Catch Effort Predators calculate the cost of pursuing and consuming prey using the prey’s size and density, and the distance to the target. \\[ H_{effort} = \\gamma \\cdot S_{prey} \\cdot D_{patch} \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\rho_{patch}} \\right) \\] Where: \\(H_{effort}\\) is the handling effort for the predator. \\(S_{prey}\\) is the size of the prey. \\(D_{patch}\\) is the distance between predator and prey. \\(\\rho_{patch}\\) is the prey density in the patch. \\(\\gamma\\) is a handling cost coefficient. Biological Justification: Prey that are farther away or more dispersed are harder to catch. Denser prey clusters reduce handling time by enabling rapid repeat captures. 14.7.6 Gape Filtering Predators apply a binary filter before pursuit, excluding prey that exceed their maximum ingestible size. \\[ P_{pursue} =\\begin{cases}1 &amp; \\text{if } S_{prey} \\leq G_{pred} \\\\0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases} \\] Where: \\(P_{pursue}\\) is the pursuit decision (1 = pursue, 0 = ignore). \\(S_{prey}\\) is the size of the prey. \\(G_{pred}\\) is the predator’s gape limit. Biological Justification: Predators cannot capture or ingest prey that are too large, so these individuals are ignored even if they are detected. 14.7.7 Energy Gain by Predators \\[ E_{agent} = E_{agent} - E_{burst} \\] Where: \\(E_{agent}\\) is the current energy of the predator. \\(E_{burst}\\) is the energy cost per unit of bursting behavior. Biological Justification: Bursting reduces available energy. Energy cost is a limiting factor for predation. 14.7.8 Energy Depletion by Prey \\[ E_{agent} = E_{agent} - E_{flee} \\] Where: \\(E_{agent}\\) is the current energy of the prey. \\(E_{flee}\\) is the energy cost per unit of fleeing behavior. Biological Justification: Fleeing reduces available energy and increases recovery time. Energy loss is a limiting factor for repeated escape attempts.
