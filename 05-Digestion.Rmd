# Digestion

## Overview

Digestion converts consumed prey mass into usable energy and transfers associated contaminants such as inorganic mercury and methylmercury from stomach contents into internal body burden pools. This submodel simulates the breakdown of ingested prey at a rate proportional to the agent’s current metabolic rate. As stomach contents are digested, a fraction is converted into energy while mercury and methylmercury are incorporated into the agent’s contaminant loads. When stomach contents reach zero, agents transition into foraging mode and begin drawing on lipid reserves.

## Purpose

To simulate how migratory fish process ingested prey into energy and contaminants while linking digestive performance to metabolic rate, foraging behavior, and exposure risk. Digestion provides the energetic foundation required for movement, migration, and physiological processes while directly influencing contaminant accumulation.

## Process Overview and Scheduling

1.  Set digestion rate equal to the current metabolic rate.\
2.  Calculate the mass digested during the current tick.\
3.  Compute the corresponding amounts of inorganic and methylmercury digested.\
4.  Remove digested prey mass and associated contaminants from stomach contents.\
5.  Convert a fraction of digested biomass into usable energy.\
6.  Add mercury and methylmercury to cumulative body burden pools.\
7.  When stomach contents reach zero, set foraging to true and begin lipid use.

## Design Concepts

**Basic Principles:**\
Digestion is modeled as a metabolic rate dependent process, where higher metabolic demand results in greater digestive throughput. Contaminants are transferred into the agent’s body burden proportionally to the fraction of mass digested.

**Emergence:**\
Patterns of energy gain and contaminant uptake emerge from interactions among foraging success, metabolism, digestion efficiency, and prey availability.

**Adaptation:**\
Agents respond to depleted stomach contents by transitioning into foraging mode and initiating lipid catabolism when necessary.

**Objectives:**\
Agents maximize energetic intake to support migration, physiological function, and survival while minimizing energetic deficits.

**Sensing:**\
Agents sense their own energetic state through stomach contents and energy levels.

**Stochasticity:**\
Stochasticity arises indirectly from variation in prey encounters or foraging success, although digestion itself is deterministic.

**Collectives:**\
Digestion occurs independently for each agent and does not require group level dynamics.

**Observation:**\
Outputs of interest include digested mass per tick, gained energy, contaminant uptake, and cumulative contaminant burdens.

## Initialization

| Variable | Initialized Value | Justification |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| stomach-contents | 0 | Agents begin without prey unless defined by scenario. |
| stomach-contents-Hg | 0 | No initial inorganic mercury from digestion. |
| stomach-contents-MeHg | 0 | No initial methylmercury from digestion. |
| digestion-efficiency | Species specific | Determines fraction of biomass converted to energy. |
| foraging | true | Agents begin in search mode when stomach is empty. |

## Submodels

### Digestion Rate and Breakdown

Digestive throughput is driven by metabolic rate:

$$
digestion\text{-}rate = metabolism\text{-}rate
$$

Digested mass per tick:

$$
digested = stomach\text{-}contents \cdot digestion\text{-}rate
$$

Proportional mercury assimilation:

$$
digested\text{-}Hg = \left( \frac{digested}{stomach\text{-}contents} \right) \cdot stomach\text{-}contents\text{-}Hg
$$

$$
digested\text{-}MeHg = \left( \frac{digested}{stomach\text{-}contents} \right) \cdot stomach\text{-}contents\text{-}MeHg
$$

Updated stomach contents:

$$
stomach\text{-}contents = stomach\text{-}contents - digested
$$

### Energy Conversion

Energy gained from digestion:

$$
gained\text{-}energy = digested \cdot digestion\text{-}efficiency \cdot 40
$$

Updated energy pool:

$$
energy = energy + gained\text{-}energy
$$

### Contaminant Assimilation

Contaminants absorbed during digestion:

$$
mehg\text{-}foraging = digested\text{-}MeHg
$$

$$
hg\text{-}foraging = digested\text{-}Hg
$$

Accumulated body burden:

$$
mehg\text{-}total = mehg\text{-}total + digested\text{-}MeHg
$$

$$
hg\text{-}total = hg\text{-}total + digested\text{-}Hg
$$

### Transition to Foraging

When stomach contents reach zero:

-   lipid-loss is activated

This switches the prey to burn fat energy reserves instead of relying on stomach contents
