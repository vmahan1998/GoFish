# Filter Feeding

## Overview

Filter feeding is a foraging behavior in which fish consume suspended particulate matter as they migrate through estuarine and coastal systems. In this submodel, agents evaluate neighboring patches based on suspended particulate matter concentration and selectively filter feed where energetic return is highest. Filtration capacity increases with body size, metabolic rate, and digestion efficiency, and is reduced under competition from other filter feeding fish. Contaminant loads in the water column directly influence mercury and methylmercury assimilation during feeding, including biomagnification effects.

## Purpose and Patterns

The purpose of this submodel is to simulate ecologically realistic filter feeding behavior in migratory fish using suspended particulate matter as a food resource. This behavior links hydrodynamic particle fields to energy gain, contaminant exposure, and movement decisions. Filter feeding only occurs when spatial conditions and energetic returns are favorable, and incorporates competition, biomagnification, and digestion constraints.

This submodel represents the following ecological patterns:

-   **Filtration capacity increases with body size, metabolism, and digestive efficiency**\
    Larger individuals with higher metabolism filter more water and assimilate more prey mass.

-   **Gaussian SPM preference centered on optimal SPM**\
    Feeding intensity is highest near an optimal SPM range and decreases away from that peak.

-   **Crowding penalty from con-specifics**\
    Filtration benefit decreases when multiple individuals feed in the same patch.

-   **Movement toward highest benefit**\
    Fish move toward the patch with the highest filtration benefit based on SPM and competitive pressure.

-   **Contaminant assimilation tied directly to filtration**\
    Mercury and methylmercury are assimilated proportionally to SPM concentration and biomagnification factors derived from empirical trophic magnification relationships.

## Process Overview and Scheduling

1.  Compute filtration capacity based on size, metabolism, and digestion efficiency.\
2.  Evaluate neighboring patches using a Gaussian suitability curve around optimal SPM.\
3.  Apply a competition penalty based on the number of con-specifics feeding on each patch.\
4.  Select the patch with the highest filtration benefit.\
5.  Move toward the chosen patch with travel distance reduced by swimming efficiency.\
6.  Apply swimming energy cost.\
7.  Filter feed by assimilating SPM scaled biomass from the chosen patch.\
8.  Assimilate mercury and methylmercury using biomagnification factors from Lavoie et al (2013).\
9.  Add assimilated biomass and contaminants to stomach contents.

## Design Concepts

**Basic Principles**\
Filter feeding reflects how pelagic and estuarine fish forage on suspended particles while migrating. Filtration scales with size, metabolism, and digestive efficiency. SPM determines food availability and contaminant exposure.

**Emergence**\
Feeding hotspots emerge where hydrodynamic SPM fields align with optimal SPM and competition is minimal. Contaminant loads emerge from local mercury and methylmercury concentrations and biomagnification.

**Adaptation**\
Agents adjust their direction and feeding behavior based on SPM quality, filtration capacity, and local competition.

**Sensing**\
Agents sense SPM, mercury, methylmercury, competition from conspecifics, stomach fullness, and their own metabolic and digestive state.

**Stochasticity**\
Variation in SPM quality, contaminant concentrations, and local competition create variability in feeding and assimilation outcomes.

**Interaction**\
Competition reduces filtration benefit when more fish feed on the same patch. Mercury and methylmercury assimilation depends on local contaminant levels and feeding intensity.

**Observation**\
The model tracks biomass intake, mercury and methylmercury assimilation, stomach contents, and contaminant load added per patch.

| stomach-contents-Hg | 0 | No initial inorganic mercury from feeding |
| stomach-contents-MeHg | 0 | No initial methylmercury |
| digestion-efficiency | Species specific | Determines fraction of filtered biomass assimilated |
| optimal-SPM | Species specific | Represents preferred SPM concentration |

## Submodels

### Filtration Capacity

Filtration scales with size, metabolism, and digestion efficiency:

$$
Filtration_{base} = \left(\frac{size}{100}\right) \cdot metabolism\_{rate} \cdot digestion\_{efficiency}
$$

### SPM Interest (Gaussian Suitability)

Suitability peaks at the optimal SPM and declines with distance:

$$
Interest = e^{-\frac{(SPM - optimalSPM)^2}{2 \cdot \sigma^2}}
$$

Where $\sigma$ is the SPM standard deviation tolerance (here 25).

### Benefit Calculation

Benefit for each neighboring patch:

$$
Benefit = SPM \cdot Interest \cdot Filtration_{base}
$$

If con-specifics are present:

$$
Benefit = \frac{Benefit}{N_{conspecifics}}
$$

### Movement

Travel distance is reduced by swimming efficiency:

$$
Distance = min(DistanceToPatch,\ speed \cdot swim\_{efficiency})
$$

Energy cost of swimming:

$$
Energy = Energy - (E\_{swim} \cdot Distance)
$$

### Feeding and Stomach Loading

Assimilated biomass:

$$
Intake = min(PreyAssimilated,\ StomachCapacity - StomachContents)
$$

### Contaminant Assimilation and Biomagnification

Biomagnification factors follow @lavoie_biomagnification_2013:

$$
BMF_{MeHg} = 10^{(0.24 \cdot \Delta TP)}
$$

$$
BMF_{Hg} = 10^{(0.14 \cdot \Delta TP)}
$$

With $\Delta TP = 1$:

$$
BMF_{MeHg} = 10^{0.24} \approx 1.74
$$

$$
BMF_{Hg} = 10^{0.14} \approx 1.38
$$

Assimilation equations:

$$
MeHg_{assim} = SPM \cdot MeHg_{patch} \cdot BMF_{MeHg} \cdot PreyAssimilated
$$

$$
Hg_{assim} = SPM \cdot Hg_{patch} \cdot BMF_{Hg} \cdot PreyAssimilated
$$

Stomach contaminant update:

$$
StomachMeHg = StomachMeHg + MeHg_{assim}
$$

$$
StomachHg = StomachHg + Hg_{assim}
$$
