Anadromous fish species such as river herring, striped bass, salmon, and sturgeon navigate coastal and estuarine systems that are increasingly affected by human activity, climate change, and legacy contaminants. Modeling their movement and behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales requires tools that can integrate physiological stressors, environmental variability, and behavior-based decision-making.

Agent-based models are among the most powerful tools available for ecological forecasting and fisheries management, but they are also among the most complex. Their structure and computational demands can make them difficult to apply in practical management settings. Many biologists and ecologists who hold deep, species-specific expertise often have limited training in advanced programming or systems modeling.

As a result, traditional approaches to simulating anadromous fish frequently oversimplify or exclude key biological functions and environmental interactions such as salinity exposure and contaminant exposure. Existing models also lack standardized representations of these behaviors and interactions, limiting the applicability of results and reducing their usefulness for applied management. This function library was developed to address these limitations by offering modular, empirically grounded components designed for use in modeling migratory fish. Each function is clearly documented and can be applied independently, allowing for transparent testing, modification, and reuse across a wide range of ecological scenarios and sites.

## Introduction to Agent-Based Models

Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate the behavior of individual organisms—called “agents”—and how their interactions with each other and with their environment create larger-scale patterns. Each agent follows a set of simple rules based on physiology, behavior, or environmental cues. When many agents follow these rules simultaneously, complex system-level outcomes emerge, such as migration pathways, schooling patterns, habitat bottlenecks, or exposure hotspots. ABMs are especially useful for ecological systems because they allow researchers and communities to explore how individual decisions scale up to influence population dynamics, habitat use, and risk in changing environments.

ABMs are designed to capture processes that depend on **behavior**, **timing**, **environmental variability**, and **individual differences**. They allow modelers to explore how organisms respond to their surroundings, make movement decisions, and interact with other individuals or species. Because agents experience the environment at fine spatial and temporal scales, ABMs can reveal patterns that occur only when many individuals interact across a dynamic landscape.

### What ABMs Can Help Us Understand

ABMs can answer questions related to:

-   How individual movement decisions accumulate into migration routes or staging locations

-   When and where organisms are most exposed to environmental risks

-   How behaviors such as foraging, schooling, predator avoidance, resting, or spawning influence exposure or survival

-   How variation in traits (size, energy, age, or species) contributes to different outcomes

-   How environmental conditions shape habitat use, movement choices, or interactions between species

-   How system-level patterns emerge from local behaviors and simple rules

-   How alternative conditions or restoration actions might alter movement, habitat use, or exposure

These models are especially useful when management questions depend on **patterns created by individual behavior**, rather than population totals alone.

### What ABMs Are Not Designed to Do

ABMs cannot provide or replace:

-   Exact estimates of population abundance

-   Precise contaminant concentrations inside individual organisms

-   Direct measurements of chemical or physiological processes

-   Predictions of exact numbers of predation or spawning events

-   Large-scale demographic projections without additional modeling components

-   Replacements for field sampling, monitoring programs, or laboratory measurements

Instead, ABMs offer **process-based insight**, showing how behavior and environmental conditions interact to create observable patterns.

### Emergent Behaviors

```

Emergent behavior refers to patterns that arise when many individual agents follow their own rules, creating outcomes that cannot be predicted from observing a single fish on its own. These outcomes develop only when many individuals interact with each other and respond to their surrounding environment at the same time. Many ecological processes such as migration timing, habitat bottlenecks, exposure hotspots, schooling dynamics, predator and prey encounters, and shifts in group structure are emergent rather than linear. They form through small, individual decisions that accumulate into larger and sometimes unexpected system-level patterns.

By visualizing and simulating emergence, ABMs make it possible to see how these individual behaviors scale up to influence population level outcomes and habitat use patterns. This helps identify the specific conditions, behaviors, and locations that shape system-wide responses. For management, this is valuable because it shows how small-scale decisions made by individual fish can contribute to broader patterns that influence risk, habitat quality, restoration effectiveness, management actions, and ecological resilience. Understanding emergence allows managers and communities to explore why certain patterns occur, identify potential leverage points, and anticipate how changes in environmental conditions may alter system behavior in the future.

## Structure

Each chapter in this library corresponds to a major behavior, physiological function, or foundational component relevant to migratory fish, beginning with:

-   **Co-Development of Agent-Based Models**

-   **Calculate Metabolism**

-   **Salinity Exposure**

-   **Temperature Exposure**

-   **Contaminant Exposure**

-   **Digestion**

-   **Filter Feeding**

-   **Lipid Catabolism**

-   **Landward Migration**

-   **Seaward Migration**

-   **Schooling**

-   **Selective Tidal Stream Transport**

-   **Predator-prey interactions**

The final chapter provides guidance on how to integrate multiple functions into a complete agent-based model, demonstrating how these components work together to simulate fish behavior in dynamic coastal and estuarine systems.

Within each chapter, each function or behavior is documented using the ODD protocol (Grimm et al., 2006; 2010; 2020). The ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol is a standardized framework for describing agent-based models. It promotes transparency in model development and ensures consistency across implementations, especially when integrating multiple behavioral or ecological functions.

-   **Overview** provides the purpose of the model component, identifies the entities involved (e.g., fish agents, environmental patches), and outlines the general processes.

-   **Design** concepts describe the key theoretical underpinnings such as emergence, adaptation, objectives, sensing, stochasticity, and interaction.

-   **Details** specify initialization steps, input data requirements, and the rules or submodels that govern behavior.

By following the ODD protocol, this library ensures that each function is self-contained, interpretable, and ready for adaptation to a wide range of species, sites, or management scenarios.

## Application Context

This library was originally developed in support of research on the influence of tidal behavior and contaminant exposure on anadromous fish in the Penobscot River Estuary. However, its modular design allows for application to other estuarine and coastal systems where fish respond to environmental changes (i.e., salinity, velocity, and pollutants).

## How to Use This Library

Each function or behavior in this library can be combined with others to build a complete agent-based model for anadromous fish. These functions are designed to be adaptable, and easily configured for different species, life stages, or site-specific conditions.
