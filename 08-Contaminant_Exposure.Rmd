# Contaminant Exposure

## Overview

The contaminant exposure submodel simulates mercury and methylmercury exposure risk across gills for migratory fish moving through spatially and temporally variable contamination fields. Exposure risk depends on contaminant concentration, suspended particulate matter, and metabolic rate. Concentrations of mercury and methylmercury are normalized across the spatial domain, and depth averaged SPM values modulate risk to reflect particle bound contaminant transport. Agents accumulate both instantaneous and cumulative exposure, allowing estimation of bioaccumulation risk over the migration season.

## Purpose

To evaluate mercury and methylmercury exposure and bioaccumulation risk for migratory fishes by integrating patch level contamination, ionregulatory stress, depth averaged suspended particulate matter, and metabolism driven uptake processes in estuarine and coastal systems.

## Process Overview and Scheduling

1.  Retrieve mercury, methylmercury, and depth averaged SPM values from the current patch.\
2.  Normalize patch contaminants between 0 and 1.\
3.  Compare patch levels to stress thresholds.\
4.  Update exposure durations.\
5.  Compute uptake risk using metabolism, ionregulatory stress, and SPM.\
6.  Add uptake risk to cumulative body burden.\
7.  Update patch level species specific risk metrics.

## Design Concepts

**Basic Principles:**\
Contaminant uptake follows toxicokinetic principles where absorption increases with concentration, metabolic rate, and suspended particulate matter (SPM). Depth averaged SPM reflects hydrodynamic transport and particle bound contaminant processes for fish typically found near the middle of the water column.

**Emergence:**\
Exposure and risk patterns emerge from individual movement across heterogeneous contamination fields coupled with metabolic and stress driven physiology.

**Adaptation:**\
Agents do not actively avoid contamination, but their internal physiology modulates uptake in response to metabolic changes.

**Objectives:**\
This model does not give agents risk minimization behavior. Instead, risk is assessed to evaluate means of exposure pathways and cumulative toxic exposure.

**Sensing:**\
Agents sense patch level mercury, methylmercury, SPM, and internal metabolic state.

**Stochasticity:**\
Variation in spatial contaminant fields or individual characteristics and state creates stochastic variation in exposure.

**Observation:**\
Outputs include instantaneous exposure risk, cumulative exposure risk, normalized exposure totals, and patch level species specific contributions.
