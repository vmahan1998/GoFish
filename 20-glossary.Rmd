# Glossary {-}

This glossary defines key terms used throughout this book.  
Terms are organized alphabetically for clarity.

---

## A {-}

### **Acclimated Salinity**
The salinity level a fish has gradually adjusted to and can tolerate without stress.

### **Agent**
A virtual organism (e.g., fish) in the agent-based model that makes decisions and moves through space.

### **Allometric**
A biological scaling relationship where physiological processes such as metabolism, growth, or filtration capacity scale nonlinearly with body size and/or age rather than proportionally (linearly).

### **Anadromous**
Fish that hatch in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to grow, and return to freshwater to spawn.

### **Base Energy**
The minimum energy required for basic physiological maintenance under resting conditions.

---

## B {-}

### **Benthic**
Related to the bottom of a water body, where some fish feed or rest.

### **Bioaccumulation**
The gradual buildup of contaminants like mercury in a fish over time.

### **Biomagnification**
Increase in contaminant concentration as it moves up the food chain from prey to predator.

### **Bottom Feeding**
A feeding strategy where fish forage along the riverbed or estuary floor.

### **Broadcast Spawning**
A reproductive strategy where males and females release sperm and eggs freely into the water column.

---

## C {-}

### **Chloride Cells**
Specialized gill cells that regulate salt balance during transitions between fresh and saltwater.

### **Contamination**
Presence of toxins or pollutants (e.g., mercury) in water or sediment.

### **Current Velocity**
Speed and direction of water movement at a location.

---

## D {-}

### **Diadromous**
Fish that migrate between freshwater and saltwater as part of their life cycle.

### **Digestion**
The physiological process by which ingested biomass is broken down and converted into usable energy.

### **Depth (Bathymetry)**
Vertical distance from water surface to the bottom; influences habitat and hydrodynamics.

---

## E {-}

### **Ebb**
Outgoing tide when water flows toward the sea.

### **Environmental Stress**
Physiological stress caused by environmental conditions such as salinity or temperature extremes.

---

## F {-}

### **Filter Feeding**
Feeding method where fish strain tiny particles (plankton, detritus, SPM) from water using gill structures.

### **Flood**
Incoming tide when water flows inland.

### **Flood Limit**
The maximum upstream reach of tidal influence.

---

## H {-}

### **Homing**
The ability of fish to return to their birthplace to spawn.

### **Homeostasis**
Maintenance of stable internal conditions such as temperature and ion balance.

---

## I {-}

### **Iteroparous**
Species that can spawn multiple times across their lifespan.

---

## L {-}

### **Landward Migration**
Movement from the ocean into estuaries or rivers, often for spawning.

### **Lipid Catabolism**
The mobilization and breakdown of stored lipids to meet energetic demands when food intake is insufficient.

---

## M {-}

### **Mercury**
A toxic metal that accumulates in aquatic systems and organisms.

### **Metabolism**
The total energy expenditure required for physiological maintenance, swimming, digestion, osmoregulation, and other biological processes.

### **Methylmercury**
A highly toxic, bioaccumulative form of mercury.

---

## O {-}

### **Optimal Temperature**
Temperature range where fish perform best physiologically.

### **Osmoregulation**
Physiological process of regulating internal salt and water balance.

### **Osmoregulatory Energy**
Energy required to maintain ion balance under varying salinities.

---

## P {-}

### **Pairwise Spawning**
A reproductive strategy requiring a male and female to occupy the same location for fertilization.

### **Patch**
A discrete spatial cell in an agent-based model with its own environmental attributes.

### **Pelagic**
Relating to open-water habitats away from the bottom.

---

## S {-}

### **Salinity**
Concentration of dissolved salts in water.

### **Salinity Stress**
Energy strain caused when salinity deviates from a fish’s preferred range.

### **Salt Wedge**
A dense layer of seawater intruding beneath freshwater in an estuary.

### **Seaward Migration**
Movement from rivers or estuaries toward the ocean.

### **Selective Tidal Stream Transport (STST)**
Behavior where fish exploit tidal currents to assist migration.

### **Semelparous**
Species that spawn once and then die.

### **Spawning**
Release of eggs and sperm for reproduction.

### **Staging**
A temporary resting or holding phase in migration.

### **Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM)**
Fine particles (sediment, organic matter) suspended in the water column.

### **Swimming Difficulty**
Effort required to swim based on flow direction and strength.

### **Swimming Energy**
Energy expenditure required for locomotion.

### **Swimming Speed (Velocity)**
Rate of movement relative to water.

---

## T {-}

### **Temperature**
Water temperature; major driver of metabolism and behavior.

### **Temperature Stress**
Stress caused when water is too warm or too cold for optimal performance.

### **Thermal Tolerance**
Range of temperatures within which a fish can survive and function.

### **Thermoregulation**
Behavioral regulation of temperature by moving into warmer or cooler habitats.
