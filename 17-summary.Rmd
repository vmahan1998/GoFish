# Modeling Toolkit

## Learning Resources

-   **NetLogo Library**: Brief note on structure (e.g., model categories), how you used it (e.g., behavior ideas, calibration).
-   **NetLogo User Manual**: Link to official documentation.
-   **NetLogo Modeling Commons**: Peer-contributed models, code sharing, and idea sourcing.
-   **NetLogo Forum**: Where to get help or search issues.
-   **Book References**:

```         
-    Railsback & Grimm (2019) *Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling*

-    Grimm & Railsback (2005) *Individual-Based Modeling and Ecology*

-    Add others specific to modeling.
```

## Best Practices

-   **ODD Protocol (Overview, Design concepts, Details)**: Follow for transparent and structured documentation of agent-based models. Ensures clarity across entities, processes, and assumptions.

-   **Modular Design**: Structure behavioral functions into separate procedures (e.g., swimming, osmoregulation, staging) to support testing, integration, and reuse.

-   **Version Control**: Use GitHub or other tools to track changes and link code to research outputs.

-   **Model File structure**:

-   **Journal References**:
