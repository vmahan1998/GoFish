It is designed to support the standardization and implementation of ABMs in fisheries management, enabling researchers and practitioners to address complex environmental questions and evaluate remediation or restoration scenarios. Motivation The goal of this resource is to support students, researchers, and decision-makers by making agent-based modeling of migratory fish more accessible, reproducible, and applicable to real-world fisheries and habitat management challenges. By providing a standardized modular framework for key behavioral processes, this library promotes consistency, transparency, and credibility in ecological forecasting and decision support tools. It also establishes a foundation for critical conversations about the behaviors and functions represented in modeling, while supporting the empirical quantification of ecological relationships that influence movement, survival, and habitat use of migratory fish. "],["overview.html", "Chapter 1 Overview 1.1 Background 1.2 Introduction to Agent-Based Models 1.3 Structure 1.4 Application Context 1.5 How to Use This Library", " Chapter 1 Overview 1.1 Background Anadromous fish species such as river herring, striped bass, salmon, and sturgeon navigate coastal and estuarine systems that are increasingly affected by human activity, climate change, and legacy contaminants. Modeling their movement and behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales requires tools that can integrate physiological stressors, environmental variability, and behavior-based decision-making. Agent-based models are among the most powerful tools available for ecological forecasting and fisheries management, but they are also among the most complex. Their structure and computational demands can make them difficult to apply in practical management settings. Many biologists and ecologists who hold deep, species-specific expertise often have limited training in advanced programming or systems modeling. As a result, traditional approaches to simulating anadromous fish frequently oversimplify or exclude key biological functions and environmental interactions such as salinity exposure and contaminant exposure. Existing models also lack standardized representations of these behaviors and interactions, limiting the applicability of results and reducing their usefulness for applied management. This function library was developed to address these limitations by offering modular, empirically grounded components designed for use in modeling migratory fish. Each function is clearly documented and can be applied independently, allowing for transparent testing, modification, and reuse across a wide range of ecological scenarios and sites. 1.2 Introduction to Agent-Based Models Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate the behavior of individual organisms—called “agents”—and how their interactions with each other and with their environment create larger-scale patterns. Each agent follows a set of simple rules based on physiology, behavior, or environmental cues. When many agents follow these rules simultaneously, complex system-level outcomes emerge, such as migration pathways, schooling patterns, habitat bottlenecks, or exposure hotspots. ABMs are especially useful for ecological systems because they allow researchers and communities to explore how individual decisions scale up to influence population dynamics, habitat use, and risk in changing environments. ABMs are designed to capture processes that depend on behavior, timing, environmental variability, and individual differences. They allow modelers to explore how organisms respond to their surroundings, make movement decisions, and interact with other individuals or species. Because agents experience the environment at fine spatial and temporal scales, ABMs can reveal patterns that occur only when many individuals interact across a dynamic landscape. 1.2.1 What ABMs Can Help Us Understand ABMs can answer questions related to: How individual movement decisions accumulate into migration routes or staging locations When and where organisms are most exposed to environmental risks How behaviors such as foraging, schooling, predator avoidance, resting, or spawning influence exposure or survival How variation in traits (size, energy, age, or species) contributes to different outcomes How environmental conditions shape habitat use, movement choices, or interactions between species How system-level patterns emerge from local behaviors and simple rules How alternative conditions or restoration actions might alter movement, habitat use, or exposure These models are especially useful when management questions depend on patterns created by individual behavior, rather than population totals alone. 1.2.2 What ABMs Are Not Designed to Do ABMs cannot provide or replace: Exact estimates of population abundance Precise contaminant concentrations inside individual organisms Direct measurements of chemical or physiological processes Predictions of exact numbers of predation or spawning events Large-scale demographic projections without additional modeling components Replacements for field sampling, monitoring programs, or laboratory measurements Instead, ABMs offer process-based insight, showing how behavior and environmental conditions interact to create observable patterns. 1.2.3 Emergent Behaviors Emergent behavior refers to patterns that arise when many individual agents follow their own rules, creating outcomes that cannot be predicted from observing a single fish on its own. These outcomes develop only when many individuals interact with each other and respond to their surrounding environment at the same time. Many ecological processes such as migration timing, habitat bottlenecks, exposure hotspots, schooling dynamics, predator and prey encounters, and shifts in group structure are emergent rather than linear. They form through small, individual decisions that accumulate into larger and sometimes unexpected system-level patterns. By visualizing and simulating emergence, ABMs make it possible to see how these individual behaviors scale up to influence population level outcomes and habitat use patterns. This helps identify the specific conditions, behaviors, and locations that shape system-wide responses. For management, this is valuable because it shows how small-scale decisions made by individual fish can contribute to broader patterns that influence risk, habitat quality, restoration effectiveness, management actions, and ecological resilience. Understanding emergence allows managers and communities to explore why certain patterns occur, identify potential leverage points, and anticipate how changes in environmental conditions may alter system behavior in the future. 1.3 Structure Each chapter in this library corresponds to a major behavior, physiological function, or foundational component relevant to migratory fish, beginning with: Co-Development of Agent-Based Models Calculate Metabolism Salinity Exposure Temperature Exposure Contaminant Exposure Digestion Filter Feeding Lipid Catabolism Landward Migration Seaward Migration Schooling Selective Tidal Stream Transport Predator-prey interactions The final chapter provides guidance on how to integrate multiple functions into a complete agent-based model, demonstrating how these components work together to simulate fish behavior in dynamic coastal and estuarine systems. Within each chapter, each function or behavior is documented using the ODD protocol (Grimm et al., 2006; 2010; 2020). The ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol is a standardized framework for describing agent-based models. It promotes transparency in model development and ensures consistency across implementations, especially when integrating multiple behavioral or ecological functions. Overview provides the purpose of the model component, identifies the entities involved (e.g., fish agents, environmental patches), and outlines the general processes. Design concepts describe the key theoretical underpinnings such as emergence, adaptation, objectives, sensing, stochasticity, and interaction. Details specify initialization steps, input data requirements, and the rules or submodels that govern behavior. By following the ODD protocol, this library ensures that each function is self-contained, interpretable, and ready for adaptation to a wide range of species, sites, or management scenarios. 1.4 Application Context This library was originally developed in support of research on the influence of tidal behavior and contaminant exposure on anadromous fish in the Penobscot River Estuary. However, its modular design allows for application to other estuarine and coastal systems where fish respond to environmental changes (i.e., salinity, velocity, and pollutants). Can include addition project or model links here* 1.5 How to Use This Library Each function or behavior in this library can be combined with others to build a complete agent-based model for anadromous fish. These functions are designed to be adaptable, and easily configured for different species, life stages, or site-specific conditions. *For questions, feedback, guidance on implementation, or interest in adding to the library, please contact Vanessa Quintana at mahan.vanessa98@gmail.com.

The purpose of this page is to showcase the value added by co-development and increase transparency about the development of this coding library. The Penobscot Estuary Community Modeling Workshop was designed from the beginning as a co-development space for an agent based model to address mercury toxicity dynamics of anadromous fish within the estuary. The day invited Tribal collaborators, community members, managers, and researchers to shape the modeling objectives, including which species, processes, behaviors, and outputs the model should represent, and how those outputs should be represented in relation to contaminant exposure in the Penobscot River Estuary. 2.1 Core Co-Development Themes Several themes guided the design of the workshop and the way it connects to model development. Shared problem framing. The workshop centered a shared concern about mercury contamination in the Penobscot River and its effects on sea-run fish, subsistence access, and recreation use, rather than starting from a predefined modeling objective. Attention to both internal and external processes. Breakout discussions were split into two rounds, one for “internal” or biological functions of fish such as osmoregulation, thermoregulation, bioaccumulation, and resting, and the second round focused on “external processes” or external interactions with intra- or interspecific factors and environmental responses such as swimming, predation, foraging, and spawning. This structure maps directly onto modules detailed within this library. Participant driven priorities. Participants were asked which species were most important to understand for management of the system or species that should be prioritized based on community interest, which functions and interactions they believed to be relevant for understanding mercury toxicity in migratory fish, and how those behaviors should be represented. Outputs that answer real questions. Each participant had the opportunity to propose a question or hypothesis to test using the developed functions and select preferred outputs from the functions such as migration paths, exposure metrics, or habitat use. These wish-list requests now correspond to specific model output routines and visualizations. Accessible language and shared vocabulary. A glossary of terms translated physiological, hydrodynamic, and modeling concepts into accessible language. This glossary can be found at the end of this document and is intended to support a range of readers. Iterative relationships, not a single event. The workshop was framed as one step in an ongoing partnership. Feedback forms, follow-up contact options, and explicit invitations for later review are built into the process. 2.2 Workshop Development 2.2.1 Pre-Workshop Collaboration Steps Planning the workshop involved months of coordination with partners, including the Penobscot Nation, faculty and staff at the University of Maine, and federal collaborators. The planning process itself was a first stage of co-development. Key steps included: Clarifying objectives with partners. Early conversations identified contamination in the Penobscot River, migratory fish, and access to safe subsistence resources as the shared focus. Partners helped guide agenda development, identify potential participants of interest, and identify community outputs of interest to support Tribal management. Their suggestions were used when conducting outreach. Aligning model scope with community priorities. The agenda was constructed so that introductory talks on Penobscot Nation natural resource management and contaminants of interest, an overview of estuary dynamics (connection of fish + physical processes + contamination), and an introduction to agent based modeling were followed by interactive surveys and break-out discussions. This allowed participants to identify anadromous species, behaviors, and processes of interest, which then feed directly into the model design. Designing materials for many kinds of learners. Each participant received a notepad and workshop folder, which included a plain-language glossary, a participant agenda, a hypothesis and output worksheet, and a feedback form. These materials supported participants who learn best through reading, writing, discussion, or visual exploration. Break-out discussions were accompanied by visual demonstrations of function demos, allowing participants to directly address draft model functions for each behavior. Find examples below. Note: these are presentations of functions before participant feedback. Updated functions in this library reflect changes informed by the workshop. .grid-container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr)); grid-gap: 20px; margin-top: 1.5em; } .grid-item { padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; background: #fafafa; } .grid-item h4 { margin-top: 0; } .grid-item a { display: block; margin: 4px 0; } &lt;h4&gt;Osmoregulation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Osmoregultation_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Osmoregultation.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Osmoregultation_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Thermoregulation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Thermoregulation_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Thermoregulation.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Thermoregulation_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Bioaccumulation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Bioaccumulation_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Bioaccumulation.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Bioaccumulation_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Resting&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Resting_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Resting.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Resting_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Migration&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Migration_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Migration.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Migration_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Foraging&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Foraging_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Foraging.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Foraging_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Spawning&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Spawning_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Spawning.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Spawning_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Predation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Predation_Function.pdf&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Anadromous_Fish_Behavior_Fact_Sheet_Predation.pdf&quot;&gt;Info Sheet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;materials/Predation_Output_Table_35.pdf&quot;&gt;Output Table&lt;/a&gt; Preparing interactive polls and prompts. A Mentimeter survey was developed to help participants identify priority species, important environmental drivers, and fish behaviors that shape exposure. These questions now map to the list of behaviors and parameters implemented in the model. Question Example 2.2.2 Identifying Participants of Interest Participant selection was guided by the goal of gathering diverse knowledge about the river and its fish. Tribal Collaborators. Representatives from the Penobscot Nation were invited to collaborate because the Penobscot River Estuary is the Ancestral Homeland of the Penobscot Nation and other Wabanaki Peoples. It was necessary to prioritize their concerns and support their management. We wanted to give them a platform to share their work and management perspectives on migratory fish and contamination. Indigenous people have sovereign rights to migratory species, which have been deeply impacted by contamination in the estuary. Community Experts. The workshop brought in local managers, fishermen, researchers, engineers, and students whose work focuses on estuarine dynamics, fisheries, remediation, and environmental management in the Penobscot, or who focus on anadromous fish. 2.2.3 Enticing Participants to Attend The invitations and overview materials emphasized that this was a hands-on, collaborative event where participant input would shape real model structure and outputs—not a passive lecture. Copy of Invitation Strategies included: Clear framing. The overview highlighted how tidal dynamics, fish behavior, and mercury contamination intersect in the Penobscot River, and described specific opportunities for participants to contribute knowledge during breakout sessions and wish-list activities. The invitation also emphasized that participants did not need any modeling experience—only their expertise and perspectives. Concrete outcomes. Participants could request a specific model output or test a hypothesis relevant to their interests, with results attempted to be shared after the workshop (as feasible within model limitations). Relationship building. The agenda previewed time for partnership discussions, highlighting opportunities to support Tribal priorities and future collaboration on management and research questions. 2.2.4 Selecting the Venue The workshop was held at the Innovation Media Research Center at the University of Maine, a space that could support immersive presentations and movement between small and large group activities. The venue allowed for: A theater-style room with a large screen. The introductory talks and interactive survey used a dark background, low lighting, and a large screen to create an immersive experience similar to an intimate concert hall, while still leaving space for questions and discussion. A separate interactive space. Round tables, easel pads, printed handouts, and discussion areas were set up in a second room for the world-café breakout sessions, allowing participants to interact and face one another in a conversation-style setting as they discussed each function. 2.3 Facilitating the Workshop 2.3.1 Agenda Activities The agenda combined presentations, interactive polls, world-café discussions, and reflection. Key components included: Welcome, blessing, and introductions. The day opened with a welcome and words from the Penobscot Nation, followed by introductions and an icebreaker activity asking participants why they attended and what they hoped to gain. Map-based activities. Participants could pin locations on a system-scale map, connecting their lived experience and knowledge to specific reaches of the river and estuary. This place-based interaction showcased lived knowledge and gave participants autonomy over the spatial representation of the system. Penobscot Nation history and river overview. A management representative of the Penobscot Nation, Dan Kircheis, provided management context for contaminants and migratory fish, grounding the model in current work conducted within the system. Modeling overview and agent based model presentation. Modeling presentations introduced the Penobscot system, key hydrodynamic and contaminant processes, and the rationale for an agent based approach. Examples of emergent behaviors and validation were shown on a large screen to make model dynamics visible and engaging. Mentimeter priority setting. Participants completed an interactive survey about priority species, important environmental drivers, and key behaviors. These responses were summarized live and used to frame the breakout sessions. World café on internal fish processes. Small rotating groups discussed processes such as osmoregulation, thermoregulation, bioaccumulation, and resting. Discussion leaders presented demos and recorded notes, which later informed how these processes are parameterized and sequenced within this library. World café on external behaviors and conditions. A second set of rotations focused on external functions such as foraging, migration, predation, and spawning. These conversations helped identify how fish interact with their environment and where and when the model should track exposure risk. Wish list outputs. Participants wrote down specific outputs they wanted from the model and the reasoning behind each request, including migration timing, exposure patterns, energy budgets, and habitat use. The goal is to incorporate as many of these outputs as possible to support subsequent management and research. Hypothesis Form Model demo. A short demonstration of the model interface supported visual learners and connected the function modules to emergent behaviors. Partnership and next steps discussion. The workshop closed with a short session on building partnerships and identifying community projects where the model could support ongoing work. This included relationship-building between participants and completion of a follow-up survey. Participant Survey Facilitation. Facilitation roles were shared across a team of organizers and volunteers who kept time, prompted discussion, recorded notes, and supported logistics, which allowed the lead modeler to focus on listening and translating insights into model design. 2.4 After the Workshop 2.4.1 Incorporating Feedback Immediately following the workshop, participants were invited to fill out feedback forms on what they found most useful, what felt unclear or missing, and how future workshops or model development activities could be improved. Feedback is being used to: Refine explanations of agent based modeling and estuarine processes in the model interface and supporting documents, using more examples, more visuals, and clearer connections between field observations and model rules. Adjust the balance between presentation time and discussion time. Clarify how participant input has been integrated, so that people can see their contributions in the model structure and outputs rather than only in summary notes. 2.4.2 Post-Workshop Follow-Up Several tools support ongoing co-development after the workshop day itself. This work is still ongoing as products are completed and co-development of final materials continues. Hypothesis and output forms. The participant hypothesis and output form captured individual questions, preferred outputs, and desired scenarios. These forms now guide scenario design and output routines in the model (as much as feasible within model limitations and scope), and follow-up emails will share results with those who opted in. Ongoing communication. Participants who requested follow-up are being contacted with model updates, refinements, and opportunities to review model structure. Follow-up survey. The feedback form includes an option to receive a later survey on model results, which will allow participants to review outputs, comment on whether they find them credible and useful, and suggest further refinements. Tech Transfer Webinar. A planned webinar will support technology transfer of the completed model and products to workshop participants, allowing them to see how their input made it into the final product. Integration into model documentation. This co-development page, the glossary, and workshop-derived figures will be hosted alongside the developed functions to make the participatory process visible to anyone using or reviewing the simulations. 2.4.3 Acknowledgements The workshop and this co developed model were made possible by the time, knowledge, and care shared by workshop participants and organizers. 2.4.3.1 Participants Ernie Atkinson Andrea Casey Devon Gleason Heather Hamlin John Hildebrand Dan Kircheis Dianne Kopec John Kocik Dan Kusnierz Chuck Loring Dan McCaw Amelia McAvoy Sasha Milsky Elias Pinilla Darren Ranco Angie Reed Lauren Ross Justin Stevens Joe Zydlewski 2.4.3.2 Volunteers Nicolas Cyr University of Maine Katherine Daza University of Maine Joseph Dello Russo University of Maine Nalika Lakmali University of Maine Saba Molaei University of Maine Cristian Rojas University of Maine Malavika Sudhakaran University of Maine Kaylyn Zipp University of Maine 2.4.3.3 Organizers: Vanessa Quintana University of Maine; USACE Engineering Research and Development Center Gayle Zydlewski University of Maine; NOAA Sea Grant Katrina Armstrong University of Maine Todd Swannack Texas State University; USACE Engineering Research and Development Center "],["metabolism.html", "Chapter 3 Metabolism 3.1 Overview 3.2 Purpose 3.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 3.4 Process Overview and Scheduling 3.5 Design Concepts 3.6 Initialization 3.7 Submodels", " Chapter 3 Metabolism 3.1 Overview Metabolism determines the energy required for fish to maintain basic physiological function, support movement, regulate ions, digest food, and sustain long term migration. This submodel computes metabolic rate based on size, temperature, age scaling, and allometric relationships. Metabolic efficiency, based on divergence from an agent’s optimal temperature, is then scaled toward multiple internal processes including swimming, osmoregulation, and lipid catabolism. 3.2 Purpose To simulate energetically realistic metabolic costs for migratory fishes in coastal and estuarine environments by accounting for size scaling, temperature dependence, age effects, and dynamic energy partitioning across physiological processes. 3.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 3.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5-minute time steps (tick) 3.3.2 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition temperature The water temperature of the current patch used to calculate temperature dependent metabolic rate. 3.3.3 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition size Body mass or size index used for allometric scaling. age-num Age used in scaling metabolic rate. optimal-temperature Preferred temperature at which baseline metabolism is defined. max-survival-temp Maximum temperature at which the agent can survive and function.

Apply efficiency multipliers to swimming, digestion, osmoregulation, and lipid catabolism. 3.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Metabolic rate combines allometric scaling, temperature responses, and age scaling consistent with metabolic ecology theory. The model uses a Q10 temperature function, Kleiber type allometry, and age dependent reduction in metabolic intensity. Emergence: Energetic constraints emerge from interactions among size, temperature, and age. These constraints then shape movement, digestion, and osmoregulation. Adaptation: Agents adapt by adjusting internal efficiencies that influence downstream behavioral and physiological submodels. Objectives: Agents maintain adequate energy for survival and migration and balance energetic cost across processes. Sensing: Agents sense the temperature of the patch they occupy. Stochasticity: The function itself is deterministic but stochastic variation in individual size and age creates emergent metabolic variation. Collectives: Scaling uses the maximum size and age of the entire population to normalize differences among individuals. Observation: Outputs include metabolism-rate, total-metabolism, and efficiency multipliers. 3.6 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification Met-base Computed using size, age, and temperature factors Establishes a physiologically realistic baseline. swim-base Met-base times movement ratio Allocates baseline metabolism for locomotion.

This submodel simulates the breakdown of ingested prey at a rate proportional to the agent’s current metabolic rate. As stomach contents are digested, a fraction is converted into energy while mercury and methylmercury are incorporated into the agent’s contaminant loads. When stomach contents reach zero, agents transition into foraging mode and begin drawing on lipid reserves. 4.2 Purpose To simulate how migratory fish process ingested prey into energy and contaminants while linking digestive performance to metabolic rate, foraging behavior, and exposure risk. Digestion provides the energetic foundation required for movement, migration, and physiological processes while directly influencing contaminant accumulation. 4.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 4.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5 minute time steps (tick) 4.3.2 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition None required Digestion is an internal physiological process and does not depend on patch attributes. 4.3.3 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition stomach-contents Total mass of prey currently held in the stomach. stomach-contents-Hg Inorganic mercury contained within the stomach contents. stomach-contents-MeHg Methylmercury contained within the stomach contents. digestion-rate Rate of digestion equal to the current metabolic rate. digestion-efficiency Fraction of digested mass converted into usable energy. energy Total energetic reserves available to the agent. gained-energy Energy gained during the current tick from digestion. mehg-foraging Methylmercury released from stomach contents and absorbed during digestion. hg-foraging Inorganic mercury released from stomach contents during digestion. mehg-foraging-total Cumulative methylmercury risk through feeding. hg-foraging-total Cumulative inorganic mercury risk via digestion. mehg-total Total body burden of methylmercury risk. hg-total Total body burden of inorganic mercury risk. foraging Boolean indicating whether the agent is actively searching for prey. lipid-loss Boolean indicating when lipid reserves are used due to lack of stomach content. 4.4 Process Overview and Scheduling Set digestion rate equal to the current metabolic rate. Calculate the mass digested during the current tick. Compute the corresponding amounts of inorganic and methylmercury digested. Remove digested prey mass and associated contaminants from stomach contents. Convert a fraction of digested biomass into usable energy. Add mercury and methylmercury to cumulative body burden pools. When stomach contents reach zero, set foraging to true and begin lipid use. 4.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Digestion is modeled as a metabolic rate dependent process, where higher metabolic demand results in greater digestive throughput. Contaminants are transferred into the agent’s body burden proportionally to the fraction of mass digested. Emergence: Patterns of energy gain and contaminant uptake emerge from interactions among foraging success, metabolism, digestion efficiency, and prey availability. Adaptation: Agents respond to depleted stomach contents by transitioning into foraging mode and initiating lipid catabolism when necessary. Objectives: Agents maximize energetic intake to support migration, physiological function, and survival while minimizing energetic deficits. Sensing: Agents sense their own energetic state through stomach contents and energy levels.

It draws from empirical findings (e.g., Allen et al., 2009; Little et al., 2023) and includes size scaling, stress buffering, and energy constraints. These principles are implemented at the submodel level (e.g., chloride proliferation, stress calculation) to simulate realistic physiological feedbacks to changes in environmental salinity. Emergence: Ion-regulatory stress, chloride cell expression, and energy expenditure emerge from an agent’s interaction with temporally and spatially variable salinity environments. These patterns are not pre-specified but arise dynamically through adaptive physiological responses. Adaptation: Agents respond to osmotic stress by adjusting chloride cell density, a trait that buffers stress. This process allows individuals to reduce internal-external salinity gradients and maintain ion homeostasis. Objectives: Agents seek to support survival by reducing stress and avoiding excessive energy loss through regulating chloride cell expression.

The greater the stress, the higher the target chloride density the agent attempts to reach, up to a maximum threshold. Agents adjust their chloride cell density based on their current ion-regulatory stress and acclimation status. Chloride cells are not adjusted unless the agent’s energy exceeds 25%.

Each agent experiences temperature-dependent effects on movement, survival, and performance based on its local environment. Agents have defined thermal traits including an optimal temperature, a minimum viable temperature, and a maximum tolerable temperature. These constraints influence swimming speed and determine whether survival is possible in the current patch. 6.2 Purpose and Patterns This submodel captures ecologically grounded thermoregulatory behavior in migratory fish by simulating how temperature influences movement, survival, and physiological performance during migration and staging. Agents experience thermal stress based on deviations from their optimal temperature, with stress scaling nonlinearly as conditions approach species specific tolerance thresholds. Swimming speed is reduced as environmental temperature diverges from thermal optima, reflecting empirical performance curves and diminished locomotor efficiency at suboptimal temperatures. Agents calculate the energy expenditure associated with thermoregulation, with increased metabolic cost arising from reduced swimming efficiency under thermal stress. When thermal stress exceeds a threshold, agents evaluate neighboring patches and relocate to cooler or warmer areas to minimize physiological strain. Agents track cumulative time spent beyond minimum and maximum viable temperature thresholds, and mortality occurs after sustained exposure to lethal conditions. This model supports the analysis of thermal niche constraints, temperature driven habitat selection, and the vulnerability of fish to extreme temperature events in estuarine systems. Note: Using this function in combination with scaled metabolic efficiency will penalize the agent twice for temperature. Users should apply one or the other depending on model objectives, or use the metabolism function without efficiency scaling. 6.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 6.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5-minute time steps (tick) 6.3.2 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition Temperature \\(T_{patch}\\) The temperature of a given patch, derived from hydrodynamic model inputs. 6.3.3 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition Optimal Temperature \\(T_{opt}\\) Optimal performance temperature Minimum Viable Temperature \\(T_{min}\\) Minimum viable temperature for survival Maximum Viable Temperature \\(T_{max}\\) Maximum viable temperature for survival swimming speed \\(V_{agent}\\) The speed at which a prey agent is moving corrected speed \\(V_{corr}\\) The corrected speed from thermal implications time below minimum \\(t_{min}\\) Tracks cumulative cold exposure duration time above maximum \\(t_{max}\\) Tracks cumulative heat exposure duration energy \\(E_{agent}\\) Metabolic cost associated with thermoregulation swimming speed \\(V_{agent}\\) The current swimming speed of the agent. acclimation rate \\(\\lambda\\) Rate at which agent acclimates to temperature based on size, age, and species. 6.4 Process Overview and Scheduling Thermal Stress Calculation Each agent calculates thermal stress based on the deviation between the current patch temperature and its individual thermal optimum. Stress is scaled nonlinearly to reflect increasing physiological strain near temperature limits. Acclimation Agents gradually adjust their optimal temperature toward the current patch temperature using a fixed acclimation rate, simulating physiological plasticity over time. Thermal Mortality Check Agents track cumulative exposure to lethal temperatures. If the patch temperature falls below the agent’s minimum threshold or exceeds its maximum threshold for more than three consecutive time steps, the agent dies. Swimming Speed Correction Swimming speed is modified using a thermal correction factor derived from the agent’s deviation from its optimal temperature. This adjustment affects movement performance and downstream behaviors. Thermal Avoidance If thermal stress exceeds a threshold value (e.g., $S_{thermal} &gt; 7$), agents evaluate neighboring patches and move to the patch with the lowest thermal stress. Energy Cost Adjustment Swimming energy cost is scaled based on the ratio of thermally corrected speed to the agent’s base swimming speed. This reflects increased metabolic effort under suboptimal thermal conditions. 6.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Agents are ectothermic and thermally constrained. Movement and survival depend on physiological performance at environmental temperatures. Emergence: Spatial thermal gradients produce differential survival, movement, and performance outcomes across the landscape. Adaptation: Agents modify their optimal temperature slowly to match local conditions, simulating physiological acclimation. Objectives: Agents attempt to avoid lethal temperatures and maintain performance within their thermal niche while minimizing energy loss. Sensing: Agents sense local patch temperature and compare it to their thermal limits and optimal range. Interaction: Agents interact with their environment by relocating to lower-stress patches and adjusting internal states accordingly.

Depth averaged SPM reflects hydrodynamic transport and particle bound contaminant processes for fish typically found near the middle of the water column. Emergence: Exposure and risk patterns emerge from individual movement across heterogeneous contamination fields coupled with metabolic and stress driven physiology. Adaptation: Agents do not actively avoid contamination, but their internal physiology modulates uptake in response to metabolic changes.

In this submodel, agents evaluate neighboring patches based on suspended particulate matter concentration and selectively filter feed where energetic return is highest. Filtration capacity increases with body size, metabolic rate, and digestion efficiency, and is reduced under competition from other filter feeding fish. Contaminant loads in the water column directly influence mercury and methylmercury assimilation during feeding, including biomagnification effects. 8.2 Purpose and Patterns The purpose of this submodel is to simulate ecologically realistic filter feeding behavior in migratory fish using suspended particulate matter as a food resource. This behavior links hydrodynamic particle fields to energy gain, contaminant exposure, and movement decisions. Filter feeding only occurs when spatial conditions and energetic returns are favorable, and incorporates competition, biomagnification, and digestion constraints. This submodel represents the following ecological patterns: Filtration capacity increases with body size, metabolism, and digestive efficiency Larger individuals with higher metabolism filter more water and assimilate more prey mass. Gaussian SPM preference centered on optimal SPM Feeding intensity is highest near an optimal SPM range and decreases away from that peak. Crowding penalty from con-specifics Filtration benefit decreases when multiple individuals feed in the same patch.

Filtration scales with size, metabolism, and digestive efficiency. SPM determines food availability and contaminant exposure. Emergence Feeding hotspots emerge where hydrodynamic SPM fields align with optimal SPM and competition is minimal. Contaminant loads emerge from local mercury and methylmercury concentrations and biomagnification. Adaptation Agents adjust their direction and feeding behavior based on SPM quality, filtration capacity, and local competition. Sensing Agents sense SPM, mercury, methylmercury, competition from conspecifics, stomach fullness, and their own metabolic and digestive state.

In this submodel, agents metabolize stored lipid reserves to restore energy, maintain migration, and avoid starvation. Lipid use is influenced by body condition, metabolic efficiency, and the magnitude of energetic deficit. Lipid depletion also reduces body weight over time, creating a biologically meaningful cost to sustained lipid reliance. Contaminant uptake does not occur during lipid catabolism, reflecting the absence of feeding. 8.9 Purpose The purpose of this submodel is to simulate endogenous energy mobilization through lipid reserves when fish cannot meet energetic needs through feeding. Lipid catabolism allows migratory fish to continue movement and survive temporary periods of low food availability. This mechanism reflects empirical observations of lipid use during spawning migrations, overwintering, and other energetically demanding life history periods. This submodel is best used in tandpm with an energy recovery stratedge like filter feelding and digestion, or pref=dation and digesiton 8.10 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 8.10.1 Patch Variables Lipid catabolism does not directly depend on patch level variables, since no external resources are consumed. 8.10.2 Agent Variables Variable Name Definition energy Current energy level of the agent weight Current body mass of the fish original-weight Initial body mass used to scale maximum lipid availability lipid-catabolism-efficiency Efficiency with which lipids are converted into usable energy.

Determine the lipid amount needed to fill the deficit. Limit lipid use by the maximum lipid available for mobilization. Apply lipid catabolism efficiency to determine usable lipid energy. Convert mobilized lipid to energy. Reduce weight by the amount of lipid burned. Set contaminant uptake to zero during this process, since no feeding occurs. 8.12 Design Concepts Basic Principles Lipid catabolism models endogenous energy mobilization in the absence of food. Fish draw upon lipid stores when energy is low, which is a well documented physiological process during migration, overwintering, and fasting. Emergence Patterns of weight loss, energy cycling, and recovery emerge from repeated lipid use during periods of limited food access. Adaptation Agents adaptively mobilize lipids based on the severity of their energy deficit and on efficiency scaling from the metabolism submodel. Objectives Agents seek to maintain enough energy to migrate, forage, avoid predation, and prevent starvation. Sensing Agents sense their own internal energy level and lipid reserve availability. Interaction Lipid catabolism does not require environmental interaction and therefore represents a purely endogenous process. Stochasticity This submodel is deterministic. However, variation in weight, metabolism, and previous feeding creates emergent differences among individuals.

The schooling behavior in this model is adapted from the publicly available NetLogo model Fish Schooling For Predator Avoidance created by Sebastian Dobon and shared through the NetLogo Modeling Commons. That model implements classic schooling rules from the original BOIDS framework developed by Craig Reynolds in 1987 in his paper Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model (Reynolds, 1987). 11.2 Purpose The purpose of this submodel is to simulate collective movement patterns observed in migratory fish where individuals adjust their position and speed based on nearby schoolmates.

Adaptation Agents adjust heading and speed in response to nearby schoolmates. Objectives Fish do not attempt to form schools explicitly. Schooling emerges from local rules. Learning There is no internal learning. Behavior is reactive and rule based. Prediction Agents do not predict future states of neighbors. They respond to current spacing and direction.

It is triggered when the along-channel velocity of the patch exceeds the agent’s effective swimming speed, and that speed is below a species-specific minimum threshold. Once engaged, agents align with the tidal current and are carried downstream or upstream, depending on flow velocity. STST reduces the metabolic cost of movement by substituting active swimming with passive transport.

Prey initiate fleeing based on predator proximity, visual detection, and turbidity-adjusted reaction time, reflecting sensory limitations in murky estuarine water. Predators only pursue prey that are within their gape limit and provide a favorable energy return, consistent with optimal foraging theory and size-selective predation. Fleeing speed is scaled by energy and body size, capturing the biologically observed trade-off between fatigue and escape performance. Directional fleeing (left, right, up, or down) is based on the predator’s relative position, aligning with empirical studies on spatial escape responses. Patch-level alarm cues propagate fleeing behavior across prey groups, mimicking the benefits of schooling and collective vigilance in fish. Energetic constraints influence both predator foraging frequency and prey escape success, contributing to variability in encounter outcomes. Spatial tracking of predation events allows identification of high-risk zones, offering insight into how environmental conditions shape survival landscapes. 13.3 Entities, State Variables, and Scales 13.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Scales Spatial Unit: Patch (3 m x 3 m resolution) Temporal Unit: 5-minute time steps (tick) 13.3.2 Patch Variables Variable Name Definition Suspended-particulate-matter \\(SPM_{t}\\) Level of suspended material in patch (exponential difficulty increase between min and max observed in system) worse vision at max, best vision at min Prey-Eaten-in-Patch Counts how much prey are consumed in a patch Prey-in-Patch \\(prey-in-patch_{t}\\) The amount of prey currently in the patch prey-alarmed?

If so, the prey calculates reaction time based on its own size, age, flee-ability, local SPM, and the predator’s size and speed. Directional Escape If the reaction time threshold is met, the prey executes a directional fleeing behavior (scare-left, scare-right, scare-down, or scare-up), and sets the patch to prey-alarmed? = true. Schooling Response All other prey in the same patch automatically begin fleeing when prey-alarmed? = true, simulating social alarm propagation. Speed and Energy Update If the agent is fleeing, its speed increases toward max-flee, and energy is reduced based on movement cost. If not fleeing, the agent moves normally and may recover energy depending on its resting status. 13.4.2 Predator Behavior (per agent) Visual Detection The predator identifies prey within its in-cone vision, adjusted based on local SPM concentration, prey size, and predator size. Prey Filtering Prey that exceed the predator’s gape limit or whose handling effort exceeds the predator’s available energy are excluded. Prey Selection Among remaining prey, the predator evaluates candidates using an optimal foraging approach that considers size, handling effort, and net energy gain. One prey is selected. Pursuit Decision If a prey is selected, the predator enters a bursting state, increasing its speed toward max-speed. Reaction time is computed based on predator age, size, SPM, and prey proximity. Scare Prey The predator triggers fleeing in visible prey by calling the scare-prey procedure. If any prey flees, the patch is flagged as prey-alarmed? = true. Consume Prey If within striking range, the predator consumes the prey and updates variables: daytime-prey-eaten, prey-species-eaten, total-prey-eaten, and Prey-Eaten-in-Patch. Digestion If no prey are eaten, time-since-eaten increases. If the predator has reached its daily feeding limit, it enters a digestive phase. Digestion ends when both time-since-eaten and time-since-full exceed the digestion time 13.5 Design Concepts Basic Principles: Simulates predator and prey interactions in a spatial estuarine system. Behaviors such as chasing, fleeing, and feeding are determined by individual traits, patch conditions, and environmental clarity due to suspended particulate matter. Emergence: Predation hotspots develop in areas with higher prey density and better visibility. Prey movement and group alarm responses create shifting patterns of refuge and risk across the landscape. Adaptation: Prey modify their direction and intensity of escape based on the predator’s location and their own size, age, and escape ability. Predators filter out prey that are too large to consume and shift to resting behavior after reaching their feeding limit. Objectives: Predators aim to select prey that provide the highest net energy gain while minimizing pursuit and handling costs. Prey aim to avoid detection or flee successfully using both individual detection and social alarm cues. Learning: Learning is represented through Mid-aged agents generally perform better than very young or very old individuals. Prediction: Sensing: Agents rely on in-radius and in-cone vision to detect others. Detection range is influenced by water clarity, body size, and prey movement. Predators exclude prey that are too large to handle even if they fall within the visible field. Interaction: Predators and prey interact through visual detection, spatial proximity, and energy transfer through feeding. Social interactions occur through alarm cue propagation at the patch level and school level. Stochasticity: Prey selection, fleeing direction, and reaction timing include probabilistic variation. Randomness is used to reflect natural variability in movement and perception. Collectives: When one prey detects a predator and flees, all prey in the same patch respond. This collective behavior improves predator detection and increases the likelihood of survival through schooling. Observation: Key outputs include prey consumption, alarm responses, spatial predation distribution, and energy use of individual agents. 13.6 Initialization Variable Initialized Value Justification energy 100 Prey begin fully energized to allow immediate fleeing or normal movement fleeing? false Prey are not actively escaping at the start prey-alarmed? false Alarm cue inactive at start of simulation daytime-prey-eaten 0 daily counter of prey eaten starts at zero time-since-full 0 predator begins simulation hungry gape-limit function of size Large predators have wider gape limits handling-effort calculated per encounter Depends on prey traits and local patch conditions reaction-time size-, age-, and SPM-based Prey and predator values dynamically computed each tick flee-ability based on age Represents individual escape competence across age classes predation-ability based on age Mid-age predators have fastest and most accurate prey responses \\(swim_{max}\\) \\(1.5-3 \\frac{body lengths}{sec}\\) Typical value for sustained swimming speed in small pelagic fish (refer to Videler, 1993). 13.7 Submodels 13.7.1 Prey Detection Probability Visual detection of prey by predators is scaled by local water clarity, prey size, and prey movement. The effective detection radius decreases as SPM increases and increases as prey size increases. \\[ P_{detect} = \\left( \\frac{S_{prey}}{S_{max}} \\right) \\cdot e^{-SPM_t / \\tau} \\] Where: \\(P_{detect}\\) is the probability of detecting a prey agent. \\(S_{prey}\\) is the size of the prey agent. \\(S_{max}\\) is the maximum size of any prey in the system. \\(SPM_t\\) is the suspended particulate matter concentration in the current patch. \\(\\tau\\) is a turbidity scaling constant. Biological Justification: Larger prey are more visible, but high turbidity (SPM) reduces contrast and visual range. The exponential function reflects rapid degradation of visibility with increased turbidity. 13.7.2 Reaction Time Reaction time determines how quickly an agent initiates a behavior in response to a threat (for prey) or opportunity (for predators). It is influenced by SPM, size, age, and ability. \\[ RT_{agent} = \\left( \\frac{1}{F_{ability}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{opp}}{S_{agent}} \\right) \\cdot (1 + \\alpha \\cdot SPM_t) \\] Where: \\(RT_{agent}\\) is the reaction time of the prey or predator. \\(F_{ability}\\) is flee-ability (for prey) or predation-ability (for predators). \\(S_{opp}\\) is the size of the opposing agent (predator or prey). \\(S_{agent}\\) is the size of the focal agent. \\(SPM_t\\) is the suspended particulate matter in the patch. \\(\\alpha\\) is the turbidity penalty factor. Biological Justification: Smaller or younger fish tend to react slower. High turbidity delays response time. Age-related ability improves reaction time in middle-aged agents. 13.7.3 Alarm Response Propagation \\[ P_{alarm} = 1 - e^{\\frac{-n_{flex}}{k}} \\] Where: \\(P_{alarm}\\) is the probability that non-detecting prey will flee. \\(n_{flee}\\) is the number of fleeing fish in the patch. \\(\\kappa\\) is a sensitivity constant governing social responsiveness. Biological Justification: Prey benefit from collective vigilance. The more individuals that flee in a patch, the more likely others will follow. 13.7.4 Fleeing Speed The maximum speed a prey agent can reach when fleeing is scaled by body size, energy, and physical acceleration limits. \\[ V_{flee} = V_{max} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{E_{agent}}{100} \\right) + \\delta \\cdot S_{agent} \\] Where: \\(V_{flee}\\) is the maximum fleeing speed. \\(V_{max}\\) is the prey’s maximum speed. \\(E_{agent}\\) is the energy level of the prey agent. \\(S_{agent}\\) is the size of the prey. \\(\\delta\\) is a scaling factor for size-based speed increase. Biological Justification: Larger prey generally swim faster, but energy limits how much of that speed can be used. Exhausted fish flee more slowly. 13.7.5 Catch Effort Predators calculate the cost of pursuing and consuming prey using the prey’s size and density, and the distance to the target. \\[ H_{effort} = \\gamma \\cdot S_{prey} \\cdot D_{patch} \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\rho_{patch}} \\right) \\] Where: \\(H_{effort}\\) is the handling effort for the predator. \\(S_{prey}\\) is the size of the prey. \\(D_{patch}\\) is the distance between predator and prey. \\(\\rho_{patch}\\) is the prey density in the patch. \\(\\gamma\\) is a handling cost coefficient. Biological Justification: Prey that are farther away or more dispersed are harder to catch. Denser prey clusters reduce handling time by enabling rapid repeat captures. 13.7.6 Gape Filtering Predators apply a binary filter before pursuit, excluding prey that exceed their maximum ingestible size. \\[ P_{pursue} =\\begin{cases}1 &amp; \\text{if } S_{prey} \\leq G_{pred} \\\\0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases} \\] Where: \\(P_{pursue}\\) is the pursuit decision (1 = pursue, 0 = ignore). \\(S_{prey}\\) is the size of the prey. \\(G_{pred}\\) is the predator’s gape limit. Biological Justification: Predators cannot capture or ingest prey that are too large, so these individuals are ignored even if they are detected. 13.7.7 Energy Gain by Predators \\[ E_{agent} = E_{agent} - E_{burst} \\] Where: \\(E_{agent}\\) is the current energy of the predator. \\(E_{burst}\\) is the energy cost per unit of bursting behavior. Biological Justification: Bursting reduces available energy. Energy cost is a limiting factor for predation. 13.7.8 Energy Depletion by Prey \\[ E_{agent} = E_{agent} - E_{flee} \\] Where: \\(E_{agent}\\) is the current energy of the prey. \\(E_{flee}\\) is the energy cost per unit of fleeing behavior. Biological Justification: Fleeing reduces available energy and increases recovery time. Energy loss is a limiting factor for repeated escape attempts.
